<p><strong>United States Army</strong></p>
<p>The United States Army is a large and powerful force, technologically
advanced, generally well trained, and at a relatively high state of
readiness. The 1980’s was a decade of change for the US Army. Coming out
of the Viet Nam era, the new professional (vice conscript) force adopted
new organizations, new training methods, new equipment, new tactics and
overall a completely new concept of integration of combat power. The US
Army of 1994 had been tested during Operation Desert Shield/Storm in
Iraq and, although there was some improvement to make, proved to a great
extent that the reforms had worked beyond the imagination of most.</p>
<p>The US Army in Europe through the latter part of the Cold war was the
focus of the entire army structure. Led by 7<sup>th</sup> Army HQ, two
full Corps (V &amp; VII) were largely stationed in Germany with a third
Corps (III Corps) based in the US but having pre-positioned equipment
holdings in POMCUS (Prepositioning Of Materiel Configured in Unit Sets)
sites. Although problematic due to maintenance, cost, security and
standardization, this system was exercised rigorously in the annual
REFORGER (REturn of FORces to GERmany)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Reforger">Exercises</a>. By 1989
the POMCUS system was set up to rapidly deploy six divisions, support
elements and logistics to Germany, within 10 days, to reinforce the four
divisions permanently stationed there. Historically this system came to
a sudden end following the Gulf War, when VII Corps and over half of the
forces in Germany were repatriated and rapidly deactivated.</p>
<p>In the Northern Fury world the US Army has experienced some difficulty
obtaining consistent and clear government direction since the fall of
the Berlin wall. The massive effort in the Gulf War was supposed to be
the closing act to the Germany based VII Corps which, due to budgetary
pressure to reduce spending, was due to deactivate in the early ‘90s.
The increased tension from a resurgent Soviet Union has interrupted that
plan mid stride – inconvenient for both military and budgetary planners.
The end result is that some repatriation has occurred but some plans
were canceled and others modified. The main points of impact are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>7<sup>th</sup> US Army HQ remains in Europe (double hatted as CENTAG
HQ)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The 18 Division structure established by the Reagan administration
remains, therefore</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division is not deactivated (planned for
1995)</p>
</li>
<li><p>3<sup>rd</sup> Armored Division is not deactivated (in 1992)</p>
</li>
<li><p>5<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division (Mech) is not deactivated (in
1992)</p>
</li>
<li><p>6<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated
(reduced to one Bde in 94, removed 98)</p>
</li>
<li><p>7<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated (in
1994)</p>
</li>
<li><p>8<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division (Mech) is not deactivated (in
1992)</p>
</li>
<li><p>9<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated (in
1991)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Additionally all National Guard and Army Reserve ‘Training’
Divisions remain extant</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>VII US Corps HQ remains in Europe but with a reduced staff and
structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1<sup>st</sup> Armored Division moved to the US with
3<sup>rd</sup> Brigade remaining in Germany</p>
</li>
<li><p>3<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Division moved to the US with
3<sup>rd</sup> Brigade remaining in Germany</p>
</li>
<li><p>77<sup>nd</sup> and 210<sup>th</sup> Artillery Brigades moved to
the US with a POMCUS site in Germany</p>
</li>
<li><p>7<sup>th</sup> Combat Engineer Brigade is transferred from VII
Corps to 7<sup>th</sup> Army</p>
</li>
<li><p>197<sup>th</sup> Infantry Brigade (REFORGER) is transferred to
7<sup>th</sup> Army as CENTAG reserve</p>
</li>
<li><p>207<sup>th</sup> Military Intelligence Brigade is transferred to
7<sup>th</sup> Army for general support</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The ‘Berlin’ Brigade is due to deactivate in July of 1994.</p>
</li>
<li><p>56<sup>th</sup> Artillery Brigade, has exchanged its deactivated
Pershing missile systems for M270 MLRS armed with MGM-140 ATacMS
(Army Tactical Missile System) and remains a direct reporting unit
to 7<sup>th</sup> Army HQ.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The POMCUS program was expanded to include six more Brigade size
sets of equipment; 2 for 1<sup>st</sup> Armored Division, 2 for
3<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Division, and 2 for the two artillery
brigades.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to maintain enhanced security in Kuwait, 187<sup>th</sup>
Infantry Brigade Army Reserve has been activated. This is a unique
structure as Battlegroup size elements from the standing army,
National Guard and Reserve rotated through this Bde on an 8 month
tour of duty. While in Kuwait they undergo a rigorous training
program to enhance their combat capability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It should also be noted that divisions based solely in the continental
US (CONUS) except 82<sup>nd</sup> Airborne and 101<sup>st</sup> Air
Assault Divisions, only had two active brigades. The third brigade was
either National Guard or Army Reserve and these, although equipped the
same as the active units, would take a minimum of 30 days to deploy.</p>
<p>During the turmoil of the post ‘Gulf War’ moves manning in the Army
remained relatively constant. Although there was an initial dip in
strength due to planned downsizing in 91-92, it has largely been made up
in 93. The strength as of Jan 1994 is slightly smaller than its recent
peak in the late ‘80s but about 200,000 more than historic - totals of
the US Army is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Army: 755,000</p>
</li>
<li><p>Army National Guard: 450,000</p>
</li>
<li><p>Army Reserve: 582,000</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>
<p>Within the continental US (CONUS) there are six army level HQs
(1<sup>st</sup> Army to 6<sup>th</sup> Army), these are primarily tasked
a mobilization role in times of national crisis. They can be activated
for operations such as 3<sup>rd</sup> Army in the Gulf war. The two
active armies, 7<sup>th</sup> Army in Europe and 8<sup>th</sup> Army in
Korea are on full operational status. Within CONUS all active duty units
are assigned to Corps and most have a wartime deployment role. The Corps
in CONUS are:</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image2.jpg" /><strong>I Corps</strong></p>
<p>This is a small Corps charged with experimentation and development, but
also has emergency deployment tasks. It is likely that I Corp would
deploy to US Army Pacific, probably with 7<sup>th</sup> Infantry
Division (ID), along with its artillery, aviation and air defence
brigades. 9<sup>th</sup> ID is a very unique formation; it is the
testbed light wheeled vehicles and rapid ground mobility. This division
was earmarked to deploy to Northern Germany or Denmark, however its
lightly armored infantry ((HMMWV or Desert Patrol Vehicles), combined
with only having two tanks battalions (in its National Guard round-out
brigade) may have precluded its employment on that front. Its high speed
cross country mobility, on the other hand made the unit ideal for desert
operations.</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image3.png" /></p>
<p><strong>III Corps</strong></p>
<p>The complete opposite of I Corps, this corps is a massive organization
which is destined for Europe in its entirety. An initial glance at the
organization is misleading however. III Corps, in addition to its own
formations, is a holding organization for 7<sup>th</sup> Army in Europe.
Divisions tasked with rapidly reinforcing both Europe based Corps
through REFORGER are held under command of III Corps for training and
administration while in CONUS, their parent Corps have operational
command however. III Corps will deploy to northern Germany and operate
as part of NORTHAG (British Army on the Rhine) while formations
supporting V &amp; VII Corps will be under command of CENTAG (7<sup>th</sup>
US Army).</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image4.png" /></p>
<p>It is worth noting that the POMCUS policy was to move 6, now 8 divisions
to Germany in less than 10 days: 1<sup>st</sup> Cav, 1<sup>st</sup> ID,
1<sup>st</sup> AD, 2<sup>nd</sup> AD, 3<sup>rd</sup> ID, 4<sup>th</sup>
ID, 5<sup>th</sup> ID, 194<sup>th</sup> Armd Bde*, 197<sup>th</sup> Inf
Bde*, 3 ACR, 212<sup>th</sup> FA Bde plus two more FA Bdes for Northern
Fury. The last division (unless you count the three independent Bdes as
a division) is 9<sup>th</sup> ID from I Corps, which would fly over in
its entirety. The feasibility of all but the 9<sup>th</sup> ID
deployment was well practiced, as discussed earlier, 9<sup>th</sup> ID
was not well suited to the north German plain. (*From XVIII Airborne
Corps below)</p>
<p><strong>XVIII Airborne Corps</strong></p>
<p>Commonly referred to as ‘America&#39;s Contingency Corps’ this organization
has seen a lot of recent action and deployed to the Sini peninsula in
1982, Grenada in 1983, Panama in 1989 and the Gulf war in 1991. Similar
to III Corps above, this formation is also charged with holding elements
destined for Europe, but the main elements of the corps are its three
rapid deployment divisions, each one unique. 82<sup>nd</sup> Airborne
Division has a battalion task force on 24 hours notice to move anywhere
on the globe, at all times, and the remainder of a brigade moving within
3 days. The 101<sup>st</sup> Air Assault Division maintains an aviation
brigade with over 320 helicopters; more than most nations operate.
10<sup>th</sup> Mountain Division is capable of moving by air to
anywhere in the world within 10 days. 10<sup>th</sup> Mountain has a
National Guard round-out brigade but both of the other divisions are
fully manned standing army units.</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image5.png" /></p>
<p><strong>US Army Europe</strong></p>
<p>Commanded by 7<sup>th</sup> Army HQ, also acting as NATO CENTAG, these
two Corps and supporting units have been the focal point of US Army
training and development since the end of the Korean War. After the
post-Gulf War reductions this force is at its lowest point in terms of
manning since 1950, with only two fully manned divisions, six
independent or forward positioned brigades and two armored cavalry
regiments. Given 10 days to mobilize, 7<sup>th</sup> Army or CENTAG
would be a powerful force indeed, with 10 American, 7 German, 3 French
and one Canadian division at its disposal. Ten days is a long time in a
modern conflict however.</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image6.png" /></p>
<p><strong>US Army Pacific</strong></p>
<p>US Army Pacific is a diverse and dispersed organization. Commanded by
Commander 8<sup>th</sup> Army with his HQ in South Korea and having
forces in Alaska, Hawaii and Japan, this army relies very heavily on its
allies and the USAF to add armor and firepower to the fight.</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image7.png" /></p>
<p><strong>US Army South</strong></p>
<p>The 193<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Brigade is the only regular army unit in
this command. The primary purpose of this brigade is security of the
Panama Canal Zone, but it also assists the Panamanian Government and
other US agencies in conducting counter insurgency and counter narcotics
operations.</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image8.png" /></p>
<p><strong>US Army Kuwait</strong></p>
<p>In the three years following the Gulf War, tensions in the region have
increased, primarily because Iran has become increasingly hostile
towards the West and Iraq. In all likelihood this resurgent hostility is
linked to improved Iranian relations with the Soviet Union. Therefore,
in order to maintain enhanced security in Kuwait, the 187<sup>th</sup>
Infantry Brigade, Army Reserve has been activated. The brigade is a
shining example of the ‘Total Force’ concept within the US Army, the HQ,
an infantry battalion, 5-5<sup>th</sup> Artillery Battalion HQ and one
battery, Engineer Company and Cavalry Troop are from the Army Reserve.
The regular army and the National Guard provide a battalion and an
artillery battery each to the force. Each battalion rotates in for an
8-month tour of duty and mans in-place equipment, conducts an intensive
training program and then returns home. The battalions rotate at 4 month
intervals and routinely train with Kuwaiti and Saudi forces.</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image9.png" /></p>
<p><strong>US Army Special Operations Command</strong></p>
<p>The US Army Special Operations Command (USA SOC) is a relatively new
organization, formed in 1989 when all Special Forces were place under
the control of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM).
This force, trains, equips, maintains and deploys Special Forces
elements worldwide. Combined with US Navy and US Air Force Special
Operations elements operating under the control of SOCOM, it can
precipitate strategic effect with a comparatively minor force
commitment.</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image10.png" /></p>
<p><strong>US Army Reserve</strong></p>
<p>The Army Reserve is a force of 582,000 personnel, 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of
the total strength of the army. Although the vast majority are ‘part
time’ soldiers, they are well trained and equipped, subject to immediate
recall and many have regular army experience. Part of the reserve
structure are the 10 ‘Training Division’ HQs, their primary function is
to be a focus for mobilization, training and equipping mobilized troops,
and perhaps commanding those troops as a follow on formation, or
providing replacements for battle losses. Another factor to consider
when examining the diagram below, logistics units are not included, and
a large portion of the Army Reserve are logistics units.</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image11.png" /></p>
<p><strong>The US Army National Guard</strong></p>
<p>The National Guard (NG) represents 25% of the deployable army and is a
fundamental element in the ability of the US Army to succeed in battle.
Over 60,000 National Guardsmen deployed to the Gulf War including two
formed artillery brigades. The Gulf War also pointed out some
shortcomings in NG readiness and a program has been put in place to
rectify these. Some units are equipped with the latest generation of
equipment while most use slightly older kit, but even that is the same
or better than some NATO allies. Four of the NG division HQs, as well as
the IX Corps HQ, at least one artillery brigade and probably several
other elements have a follow on reinforcement role to NATO. Readiness
levels have improved since the Gulf War as have training programs. Most
units should be ready to deploy within 30-45 days of mobilization while
some will take up to 60 days of training with some re-equipping. It is
likely that more than 50,000 NG troops will deploy individually or in
small units within the first 14 days of mobilization including up to
five artillery brigades, two engineer brigades and one or two aviation
brigades.</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image12.png" /></p>
<p><strong><span class="underline">Equipment</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Main Battle Tank (MBT)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m1.htm"><strong>M1</strong></a>: The extremely
successful M1 Abrams MBT began production in 1979 and continued through
1985 when the last of 3,273 were produced for the US Army. This is a 61
ton tanks with a 105mm rifled gun, it can travel at 45 MPH (72 KPH) and
has a range of 310 miles (500 Km). This is an excellent, reliable, well
proven tank, it has the same gun as the Leopard 1, but is 50% heavier
and has a shorter range. The main concern with this MBT is high fuel
usage requiring additional logistic support. After sales to Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia, upgrades to later variants and general attrition are
factored in; there are 1630 basic M1s available to the US Army in 1994.</p>
<p><strong>M1IP</strong>: This version has improved engine performance, efficiency, and
better turret armor but in most other ways is the same as the M1. There
were 894 produced in 1984.</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image13.jpg" /><strong>M1A1</strong>: This tank, in
addition to other improvements, replaced the gun with the 120mm Smooth
bore cannon, the same gun that is on the Leopard 2. In comparison the
M1A1 is heavier but achieves the same speed (42 MPH/68 KPH) over a
longer distance 288 miles (463 Km) versus the Leopard 2 which achieves a
range of 211 miles (340 Km). By 1992 there were 4,976 M1A1s produced.</p>
<p><strong>M1A2</strong>: Although 190 were produced by 1994, there were about 1000 M1s
upgraded to a similar configuration as the M1A1 in particular upgrading
the gun. They also had a second thermal site for the commander allowing
rapid engagement subsequent targets at night or in obscured conditions.
Total available in early 1994 is
1,190.</p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image14.jpeg" /><a href="http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/M60_Patton.php"><strong>M60A3</strong></a>:
Built in the 1980s, the latest version of the ‘Patton’ MBT carried the
same British made L7, 105mm riffled gun as the M1 Abrams, with a fire
control system that produced a 70% hit probability of another tank at
2000 meters. By the time production stopped over 1700 of these tanks had
been built and another 1700 older models had been converted to this
standard.</p>
<p><strong>Disposition of MBTs</strong></p>
<p>As the M1A2 Abrams continues to be produced, an ongoing program is
cascading newer MBTs across the entire army. Formations assigned to
REFORGER have a higher requirement as they need to provide a fill set of
equipment to the POMCUS site, while maintaining a partial set for
training in CONUS. Formation assigned to 7<sup>th</sup> Army Europe,
both permanently stationed and REFORGER units require approximately
5,300 MBTs, 1,800 of which will cascade to NG units upon mobilization.
Other active army users such as I Corps, 24<sup>th</sup> ID and PACOM
require another 500 MBTs. All of these units are also equipped with the
M1A1 or M1A2 Abrams MBTs. Army Reserve elements, NG independent armored
battalions and brigades as well as the armored battalions in independent
infantry brigades and armored cavalry regiments are equipped with the
M1IP. The remaining formations are a mix of basic M1 MBTs and M60A3s.</p>
<p><strong>Armored support vehicles</strong></p>
<p>All armored support vehicles are based on the M60 chassis. Although some
support vehicles based on the M1 are in development, they are several
years from fielding. These are spread throughout the force:</p>
<ul>

(IFV)</strong></a></p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image15.jpeg" />The Bradley is the
standard infantry vehicle in the mechanized forces of the US Army. It is
armed with a 25mm ‘Bushmaster’ chain gun, has a crew of three and
carries six soldiers able to dismount to clear the enemy. By 1994
initial production was complete and upgrading older versions to meet the
latest standard was underway, this is several months faster then
happened historically. In total 4,641 M2s were built with over half
being built to the A2 ‘high survivability’ standard. All but the first
1,600 A0 variants also carried a TOW 2 missile launch system. M2
disposition is roughly equivalent to the M1A2 laydown, with Germany
based units and POMCUS sites having the latest A2 variants and CONUS
based units, Reserve or NG having the A0.</p>

Fighting Vehicle
(CFV)</strong></a></p>
<p>Almost identical to the M2 in appearance, the M3 only carries two
dismounts, with the remainder of the space used for extra radios,
storage and ammunition for the TOW missile systems. In all, 2,083 CFVs
were built and issued to all armored cavalry units, including NG units.
These had the same variant details as the M2 and once again, Germany has
the latest equipment while the older variants requiring refit are in
CONUS.</p>

Family</strong></a></p>
<p>This versatile and reliable family of vehicles has been in use for over
30 years in the US Army and has found its way into over 50 other armies
around the world. Some 34,000, primarily the standard ‘Battlefield Taxi’
variant were produced for the US, while over 80,000 were produced
worldwide. These vehicles are used in virtually every mechanized unit in
the army and are often pushed into roles they were not designed for. In
1994 the following are in the inventory:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Approximately 16,000 x A1, A2 or A3 variant standard troop carrier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>1,600 x M113A4 Armored Medical Evacuation Vehicle (AMEV)</p>

<p><strong>Artillery</strong></p>
<p>The US Army has vast quantities of artillery systems to outfit the 48
artillery brigades across the force. Each division has a DivArty Bde
generally consisting of a 155mm battalion with 18 guns working as Close
Support each maneuver brigade, plus a battery of MLRS (M270 Multiple
Launch Rocket System) and a target acquisition battery in General
Support. 82<sup>nd</sup> and 101<sup>st</sup> divisions have 105mm Close
Support battalions and a 155mm General Support Battalion. The 30
independent brigades have a wide range of configurations and are meant
to provide the Corps and Army commanders flexibility by supporting the
main effort divisions with extra fire power. Key artillery systems are:</p>

<p><strong>Air Defence systems</strong></p>
<p><img src="/fury/assets/images/nato/us/army/image19.jpeg" />The 10 Air Defence
Artillery (ADA) brigades across the army are allocated roughly one per
Corps with additional brigades under army control. There are some
independent units supporting fixed installations. Each brigade is unique
and task tailored for the rolls and responsibilities it has been given.
Generally, US Army ADA is focused on the High Level and the Very Low
Level air defence threats, leaving medium level threats to other nations
or NATO air forces to deal with. The systems in inventory are:</p>
