**Polish Navy**

The Polish navy is relatively small and focused on sea control and
amphibious operations within the Baltic Sea. Largely equipped and
trained by the Soviet Navy, the PMW (Marynarka Wojenna Polskiej or
Polish War Fleet) essentially forms an extension to Soviet Baltic Sea
Fleet. Although the fleets are interdependent, they were previously
designed to operate with the East German Fleet as well – so there are
some gaps in capabilities which the Soviets have striven to make up as
the Pols were unable to assist. The Polish fleet has largely been
languishing for the past 18 months, suffering from the internal strife
which has riddled the country, although a core of dedicated and
motivated naval officers maintained basic levels of training, there has
been little motivation and even less funding for exercises involving
more than a few ships since 1991. The prefex for Polish warships is ORP
(Warship of the Republic of Poland) and the fleet is based at two key
locations; Gdynie-Oksywie is the main base for ships, submarines,
training and aviation while Świnoujście near the German border is used
for coastal defence ships.

**Destroyer (DDG)**

The one large combat ship is a [Modified
Kashin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_Kashin-class_destroyer) class
DDG *ORP Warszawa* *271*, formerly the *Smelyy* in the Soviet Navy it
was sold to Poland in 1988 to replace the Kotlin Class ship of the same
name. A well rounded ship with good anti-surface, air defence and
anti-submarine (ASW) capabilities, the main drawback was the lack of a
hangar for the helicopter but in the restricted waters of the Baltic,
the landing platform was probably sufficient.

**Submarines**

[Kilo Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORP_Orze%C5%82_\(1986\)): The
single Kilo class (Project 877E) was transferred to Poland in 1986 and
is the centerpiece of the submarine force. In the shallow, noisy waters
of the Baltic Sea this boat is a very capable opponent.

[Foxtrot
Class](https://www.deviantart.com/zaku1986/art/ORP-Wilk-204327913): Two
Foxtrot class (Project 641) transferred to the Polish Navy in 1987,
these boats are far less capable than the Kilo class but still able to
operate effectively due to the noisy confines of the Baltic.

[Whisky V Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey-class_submarine):
The four boats of this class were transferred to the Polish Navy in 1965
and retied into reserve in 1985 as the newer boats arrived. It will take
60-90 days to make these boats operational again.

**Fast Attack Craft (FAC)**

[**Tarantul
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantul-class_corvette)

The most important class of missile craft in the Polish navy are the
four Tarantul class boats built in the 1980s. These very capable ships
carry 4x P-20M (SS-N-2D Improved Styx) radar or infra-red (IR) guided
anti-ship missiles (ASM) with a range 44 Nautical Miles. Strela-2M
(SA-N-5 Grail) MANPADS (Man Portable Air Defence System), a 76mm gun and
two 30mm Gatling guns. With a top speed of 42 Knots and both electronic
and physical defensive countermeasures these are very potent foes in the
restricted waters of the Baltic Sea.

**Osa I Class**

These 14 ships were transferred from the Soviet Union to Poland in the
mid 1960s and in the late 1980s two were decommissioned and placed into
reserve with a third deactivating in early 1994. Additionally three
boats are due to be transferred to the Coast Guard but in Northern Fury,
this transfer is stalled, they are currently unmanned and unmaintained
but have retained their weapons systems.

**ASW Corvette**

**Kaszub**

The sole ship of this class, the ORP Kaszub was designed and built in
Poland with the intent of being the lead ship of seven. Problems in both
the design and construction lead to the decision to terminate the class,
and when commissioned the ship lacked many of the weapons that were
planned. The 76mm gun was fitted in 1991 but the planned SAMs (SA-N-4
Gecko) were replaced by Strela MANPADS. She also has a 35mm cannon, four
23mm cannon in twin mounts, RBS ASW launchers and torpedo tubes.

**Patrol Craft (PC)/Fast Patrol Craft (PCF)**

**Orkan class**

These three ships were designed by East Germany as FAC where their hulls
were constructed. When Germany re-unified the hulls were towed to Poland
for completion as PCFs, and eventually (2006) converted to their
original role. These ships have a speed of over 40 Knots, a 76mm gun,
30mm Gatling gun, MANPADS and Machine guns. Generally they are
comparable to the Tarantuls except for the SSMs.

**Pilica class**

The 16 craft in this class are small (100 ton), fast (28 Knots) and
flexable. With a crew of only 12 sailors but armed with torpedoes, 23mm
cannon and potentially MANPADS, they cannot be ignored.

**Patrol Boats (PB):** About 20 are active with several others in
reserve. These are generally small craft armed with light cannon and
machine guns. There are two Kaper Class which are larger but unarmed, 12
Wisloka Class, three Oksywie class, nine Gdansk class – some in reserve,
and seven KP100 class in reserve.

**Mine Craft (MS, ML, MCM)**: Mine warfare is a major threat in the
shallow Baltic waters, therefore Poland has places significant effort in
this area. About 30 mine warfare ships are active while many more are in
reserve. Eight Grozny class ML, 13 Goplo class Coastal MS, two Leniwka
Class Coastal MS, 11 Orlik class – some in reserve, 12 Zubr class MCM in
reserve, 32 K-8 class MS in reserve.

**Amphibious Ships (LST, LC)**: Polish shipyards designed and built the
[Polnochny
Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polnocny-class_landing_ship) LSTs
in use throughout the Warsaw Pact. Able to transport 10-12 armored
vehicles, 250 troops and 250 tons of stores these ships come in three
main versions (A, B, C) with an derivative command version also in use.
With over 100 built by 1994 it is not surprising that Poland is a
primary user of this type of ship holding 26 in service, although 15 of
the older ships are in reserve.
