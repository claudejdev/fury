**Polish Air Force**

The Polish Air Force is quite large with almost 1000 aircraft;
unfortunately, due to domestic turmoil it suffers from failing, morale,
maintenance and training. Originally organized along Soviet lines with
an Air Force supporting the Army, an independent Naval Air Force and an
Air Defense Force focused solely on control of Polish airspace. Efforts
to change this to a more western approach with new reforms and
organizations were largely stalled by intransigence and lack of
political will or capacity. One significant change is that the small
Polish Naval Air Force has been folded into the Air Force. The domestic
aircraft industry in Poland was very productive throughout the Cold War,
producing everything from light training/civil aircraft (**PZL-104**)
and jet trainers (**PZL I-22**), to helicopters (**PZL SM-2**) to
derivatives of the **MiG-15** (PZL-Mielec **Lim-1 & 2**) and MiG-17
(PZL-Mielec **Lim-5 & 6**). As war breaks out in Northern Fury Poland is
in even more disorder as military formations try and determine who is in
control and where their loyalties lie.

**MiG-29**

Poland received 12 MiG-29 in 1989-1990 just before political troubles
truncated any further delivery. Nine of the aircraft were **MiG-29A**
while the remaining three were the training version (**MiG-29UB**).
Allocated to the 1<sup>st</sup> Squadron of the 32<sup>nd</sup> Air
Intercept Wing, these were meant to seize and maintain air superiority
over the battlefield and prevent NATO aircraft, particularly the F-16
and A-10 from harassing Polish maneuver forces on the ground. Although
they have the capacity for strike and close air support, this would be a
purely secondary role for the Polish Fulcrums.

**MiG-23**

The Polish Air Force operated 36 **MiG-23MF** Flogger B’s and six
MiG-23UB two seat training versions. The Floggers were also used
primarily in the intercept role to protect Polish ground formations,
although they could also be used for ground attack if needed.

**MiG-21**

About 450 **MiG-21** Fishbed are in service with about 100 more in
reserve. Most of the more modern variants are maintained for the Air
Defense role with 72 **MiG-21bis**, 120 **MiG-21MF** and 36 **MiG-21M**
as well as one Regiment of 36 ageing **MiG-21PFM** being the main
component of the Air Defense force. The remaining Fishbeds in service
are 90 **MiG-21PFM** in the Fighter Bomber role, 36 reconnaissance (R)
versions supporting the army and about 50 two seat trainers (UB). There
are about 80 older **MiG-21PF** as well as a few PFM, R and UB airframes
in ready reserve.

**Su-20/22**

The **Su-20** and **Su-22** Fitter are the primary ground attack
aircraft used by the Polish Air Force. The 27 older **Su-20**s were
acquired in the 1970s and are over-due for retirement or relegation to
reserve status. During the 1980s 90 modern **Su-22M4** were acquired
with an intent to obtain a further 45, this later purchase was overtaken
by the internal strife in the later part of the decade but 20
**Su-22UM3K** two seat trainers were delivered. The Fitters form the
lead Regiment in each of the Fighter Bomber Divisions. About 40 of the
much older **Su-7** Fitter A variants are held in reserve.

**Lim-6**

The domestic Polish aircraft industry was quite prolific and one of the
main products was the **Lim-6** Fresco, a derivative of the Soviet
**MiG-17**. About 180 of these aircraft remain in service but are
obsolete and poorly maintained. All have been upgraded to the
**Lim-6bis** or are **Lim-5** rebuilt to the same standard and called
the **Lim-6M**.
