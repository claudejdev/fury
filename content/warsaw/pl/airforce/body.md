**Polish Air Force**

The Polish Air Force is quite large with almost 1000 aircraft;
unfortunately due to domestic turmoil it was suffering from failing
maintenance and training. Organized along Soviet lines with an Air Force
supporting the Army and an Air Defense Force focused solely on control
of Polish airspace, the new reforms and organization promised by the
Solidarity Government were largely stalled by intransigence and lack of
political will or capacity. The one significant change that has occurred
is that the Polish Naval Air Force has been folded into the Air Force.
The domestic aircraft industry in Poland was very productive in
throughout the Cold war, producing everything from light training/civil
aircraft (PZL-104) and jet trainers (PZL I-22), to helicopters (PZL
SM-2) to derivatives of the MiG-15 (PZL-Mielec Lim-1/2) and MiG-17
(PZL-Mielec Lim-5/6). As war breaks out in Northern Fury Poland is in
even more disorder as military formations try and determine who is in
control and where their loyalties lie.

**MiG-29**

Poland received 12 MiG-29 in 1989-1990 just before political troubles
truncated any further delivery. Nine of the aircraft were MiG-29A while
the remaining three were the training version (MiG-29UB). Allocated to
the 1<sup>st</sup> Squadron of the 32<sup>nd</sup> Air Intercept Wing,
these were meant to seize and maintain air superiority over the
battlefield and prevent NATO aircraft, particularly the F-16 and A-10
from harassing Polish maneuver forces on the ground. Although they have
the capacity for strike and close air support, this would be a purely
secondary role for the Polish Fulcrums.

**MiG-23**

The Polish Air Force operated 36 MiG-23MF Flogger Bâ€™s and six MiG-23UB
two seat training versions. The Floggers were also used primarily in the
intercept mode to protect Polish ground formations although they could
also be used in the ground attack role if needed.

**MiG-21**

About 450 MiG-21 Fishbed are in service with about 100 more in reserve.
Most of the more modern variants are maintained for the Air Defense role
with 72 MiG-21bis, 120 MiG-21MF and 36 MiG-21M as well as one Regiment
of 36 MiG-21PFM being the main component of the Air Defense force. The
remaining Fishbeds in service are 90 MiG-21PFM in the Fighter Bomber
role, 36 reconnaissance (R) versions supporting the army and about 50
two seat trainers (UB). There are about 80 older MiG-21PF as well as a
few PFM, R and UB in ready reserve.

**Su-20/22**

The Su-20 and 22 Fitter are the primary ground attack aircraft used by
the Polish Air Force. The 27 older Su-20s were acquired in the 1970s and
are over-due for retirement or relegation to reserve status. During the
1980s 90 modern Su-22M4 were acquired with an intent to obtain a further
45, this later purchase was overtaken by the internal strife in the
later part of the decade but 20 Su-22UM3K two seat trainers were
delivered. The Fitters form the lead Regiment in each of the Fighter
Bomber Divisions. About 40 of the much older Su-7 FITTER A variants are
held in reserve.

**Lim-6**

The domestic Polish aircraft industry was quite prolific and one of the
main products was the Lim-6 Fresco, a derivative of the Soviet MiG-17.
About 180 of these aircraft remain in service but are obsolete and
poorly maintained. All have been upgraded to the Lim-6bis or are Lim-5
rebuilt to the same standard as the Lim-6M.
