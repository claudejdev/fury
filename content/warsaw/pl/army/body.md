**Polish Armed Forces**
([PVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_People%27s_Army_order_of_battle))

The Polish Army was organized along Soviet lines and until the rise of
*Solidarity* was an integral part of Soviet plans. The army had some
very good equipment, and despite the heavy reliance on conscript forces
was highly trained in the early ‘80s, but has declined significantly in
capability. Although the democratic government which came to power in
late ’89 continued to fund the force, training and maintenance began to
break down rapidly. Much of the old guard leadership was purged between
1989 and 1992 leaving significant gaps in experience as young western
leaning officers were propelled into high places. From 1992 onwards, as
failures in leadership and the outright breakdown in reorganization
began to show, the PVA experienced increased pressure and influence from
within to maintain many of the ‘old’ Soviet ways. Several of the new
guard who had thrusted well beyond their abilities experienced a
precipitous downfall, some were either summarily dismissed or jailed for
corruption – real or perceived. The year before the start of Northern
Fury was particularly tumultuous with a spike in suicides, high fatality
rates during relatively simple training exercises and plummeting moral.

The three Combined Arms Armies (CAAs) consisted of a mix of Motor Rifle
Divisions (MRD), Tank Divisions (TD) and supporting arms; these
formations, like their Soviet equivalent have varying states of
readiness:

  - Category A-divisions which have 80% or more of their full strength

  - Category B-those with between 30% and 50%

  - Category C-those with between 5% and 10%

However, due to the troubles with leadership, moral, maintenance and
training, these levels of readiness are hugely optimistic. Category A
formations should be ready to move in the matter of a few hours, but
with the exception of the Naval Infantry and Airborne Divisions will
likely take several days to organize. Category B which are supposed to
be ready in about 72 hours will likely take a week or more and Category
C, if they mobilize at all will take longer than their prescribed 60
days.

Throughout the Cold War Polish forces were destined to join the Soviet
Northern Group of Force, largely stationed in Poland, however, the
unification of Germany and the democratic revolution in Poland
significantly changed this plan. Although Poland is independent at the
start of Northern Fury, the Soviet plan, which is known to some key
Polish leaders involved in the 13 Feb Coup, is for the 1<sup>st</sup>
Polish Army to join forces from the Baltic and Belorussian Military
Districts advancing west into unified Germany. As the 2<sup>nd</sup> and
3<sup>rd</sup> Polish Armies come on line they will reinforce this
thrust. There are special tasks assigned to both the 6<sup>th</sup>
Airborne and 7<sup>th</sup> Naval infantry Divisions as well as the
3<sup>rd</sup> Surface to Surface Missile (SSM) Brigade, all of which
are at a surprisingly high state of readiness.

Although organizationally Polish units were almost identical to the
Soviet design, much of its equipment was manufactured in Poland or in
cooperation with Czechoslovakia. The basic designs were Soviet but
Poland improved them in many ways and built a large export market within
the Warsaw Pact and around the world.
