**[Czechoslovak People’s
Army](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Czechoslovak_People%27s_Army.html)
(CVA)**

Historically the Czechoslovak Army divided in 1993 along with the rest
of the country into two; the Czech and the Slovak armies, the ‘People’s’
was also dropped from the name in 1990. In Northern Fury, these changes
do not occur and the army remains roughly as it was in 1989, although
with slightly lower moral due to the virtual state of occupation
existing in our storyline, but this is countered by some better
equipment flowing from the former East Germany and additional training
opportunities working with Soviet formations.

The CVA was one of the most ready armies in the Eastern Block. Like all
WP armies it was organized along Soviet lines and integrated into Soviet
military plans. The bulk of the army, those in the Western Military
District were all fully manned and equipped. Structurally Western
Military District will form a FRONT level HQ and either operate as an
independent HQ reporting to the Soviet Central Group of Forces (CGF) an
equal level Front HQ, or more likely remain as a national mobilization
HQ. Certainly, 1<sup>st</sup> Army will be attached to CGF immediately
and is ready to conduct offensive operations, 4<sup>th</sup> Army will
follow within a week as it is at a very high state of readiness for
Category B formations. Eastern Military District would mobilize in 2-4
weeks (very quick for Category C elements) and form an Army reinforced
by a Soviet Division (30<sup>th</sup> Gds MRD), the two Tank Divisions
(13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup>) are at a relatively high state of
readiness so may be committed as reinforcements to 1<sup>st</sup> Army
earlier than that.

Home grown Czech equipment was usually superior in design and
workmanship to Soviet built and the ‘OT’ family of armored Personnel
carriers (APC) was widely exported.
