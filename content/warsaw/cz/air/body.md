**Czechoslovakian Air Force**

The Czechoslovakian Air Force operates almost 800 aircraft including 140
helicopters, about 150 training aircraft, 30 transports and almost 500
combat aircraft. Over half of the combat aircraft however are MiG-21
which would have great difficulty against NATOs front line fighter
force. As compensation for the large number of troops remaining in
Czechoslovakian territory, the Soviets have augmented their brethren
somewhat; they have given the Czechs a squadron of twelve Su-27 multi
role fighters, augmented the recent acquisition of MiG-29s with four
additional, exchanged a squadron of older MiG-23s for twelve new
MiG-23MLDs and acquired some additional Su-22s and Su-25s. These
supplements go some of the way to modernizing the Czechoslovakian air
defence forces, as does the addition on an S-300 missile battalion to
replace one of the older S-75M units.

**Su-27**

Czechoslovakia is the first country outside the USSR to receive this
very advanced 4<sup>th</sup> generation multi-role aircraft. In Northern
Fury the **Su-27 Flanker** was not sent to China as it historically was
in 1992, and instead the ‘SK’ or export variants were delivered to
Czechoslovakia. Negotiations with China are still ongoing but it is
unlikely they will be concluded for some time. The transfer took place
in early 1993 with flight training in the USSR, but there are still
several Soviet pilots on staff with the Squadron to assist with advanced
training and tactics. Due to a lack of two-seat training aircraft
available, pilots travel to the Soviet Union for qualification and
re-certification if needed. Although capable of air to ground missions,
Czech Flankers are used primarily in the air defence role as part of the
11<sup>th</sup> Fighter Regiment along with the
MiG-29s.

Originally 20 of these high performance multi-role aircraft were
delivered by 1991; this number included two combat capable **MiG-29UB**
two-seat trainers. Since this time four more aircraft were delivered and
they were consolidated into two squadrons of the 11<sup>th</sup> Fighter
Regiment. Together with the Su-27s these aircraft represent a massive
improvement in capability from the 1980’s and provide a real threat to
NATO
aircraft.

**MiG-23**

![](/assets/images/warsaw/cz/air/image3.jpg)

The Czechoslovakian air force has a mix of air superiority and ground
support **MiG-23 Floggers** and has concentrated them into two units.

Two Northern Fury events have augmented the Czech holding of this type.
Originally there were 32 modern ‘**BN**’ (Flogger H) variants used for
ground support and that remains extant; however, in the 1<sup>st</sup>
Fighter Regiment there were 36 older ‘**MF**’ (Flogger B) air
superiority fighters and about a dozen modern ‘**ML**’ (Flogger G)
types. With the unification of Germany there were surplus MiGs-23s
available which were more current than those in use so a deal was cut
where enough Flogger Gs were provided to outfit two squadrons while the
other two squadrons stayed with the Flogger Bs. Finally, in 1993, as
part of the deal with the Soviet Union both of the Flogger B squadrons
were scheduled for upgrade to the very latest ‘**MLD**’ (Flogger K) in
exchange for the older airframes, only one squadron completed the
exchange by the time Northern Fury
starts.

**MiG-21**

![](/assets/images/warsaw/cz/air/image4.jpg)

Over 260 **MiG-21**s remain in service in the Czechoslovakian air force,
from the antique **MiG-21F-13**s (Fishbed C) still used in training
through the second (Fishbed D & F) and third generation (Fishbed J) of
these versatile aircraft. The Czechoslovak uprising in 68 meant that
there were many years where the latest technology was not transferred
from the Soviets, so modern Fishbed (K, L & N) were never provided,
forcing the Czechs to use those they did have for all roles; training,
reconnaissance, air superiority and ground attack, although these latter
two roles would be quite risky against modern NATO
fighters.

**Su-22**

![](/assets/images/warsaw/cz/air/image5.jpg)

Historically, Czechoslovakia acquired 49 **Su-22M4** and 8 two seat
**Su-22UM3K**s in 1992, these are the very latest in this family of
Fighter Bomber and in Northern Fury this acquisition has been increased
to 65 single and 10 double seat versions. Negotiations are ongoing for
an additional 32 airframes to replace the remaining MiG-21s in the
6<sup>th</sup> Fighter/Bomber Regt and round out a third squadron in the
20<sup>th</sup> Fighter/Bomber Regt. The trickle-down effect of this
proposed acquisition is the retirement of the Fishbed D’s in the
Force.

**Su-25**

![](/assets/images/warsaw/cz/air/image6.jpg)

To fulfill the close support ground attack function (Assault in Soviet
terms) in close cooperation with army units, Czechoslovakia as well as
most other WP countries, acquired the **Su-25** Frogfoot. In the late
1980s the Soviets produced well over 1000 of these aircraft and 36
**Su-25K** were sent to the Czechs, plus two dual control trainers
(**Su-25UBK**). In Northern Fury Soviet, production of the Su-25T was
increased and some of the older **Su-25K**s were distributed to WP
countries, in this case an additional 12 were provided, adding a third
squadron to the Order of
Battle.

These Czechoslovakian designed and produced aircraft became the standard
training aircraft throughout the Warsaw Pact and beyond, with many going
to African and Asian Soviet aligned countries. The **L-39ZA** was an
improved design able to conduct advanced training, light ground attack
and reconnaissance. The next evolution of this aircraft was the
**L-39MS** (the ‘M’ variant was not built) which was produced starting
in 1989. Real life intervened causing production to cease early but in
Northern Fury this doesn’t happen and 24 were provided to the
Czechoslovak Air Force by the start of 1994, in addition to sales to
Egypt, Tunisia and other WP
countries.
