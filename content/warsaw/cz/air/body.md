**Czechoslovakian Air Force**

The Czechoslovakian Air Force operates almost 800 aircraft including 140
helicopters, about 150 training aircraft, 30 transports and almost 500
combat aircraft. Over half of the combat aircraft however are MiG-21
which would have difficulty against NATOs front line fighter force. As
compensation for the large number of troops remaining in Czechoslovakian
territory the Soviets have augmented their brethren somewhat; in
particular they have given the Czechs a squadron (12) of Su-27 multi
role fighters, added another four (4) MiG-29s to the recent acquisition,
exchanged a squadron of older MiG-23s for new MiG-23MLDs (12) and
acquired some additional Su-22s and Su-25s. These additions go some of
the way to upgrading the Czechoslovakian air defence forces, as does
another addition on an S-300 battalion to replace one of the older S-75M
units.

**Su-27**

Czechoslovakia is the first country outside the USSR to receive this
very advanced 4<sup>th</sup> generation multi-role aircraft. In Northern
Fury these aircraft were not sent to China in 1992, and instead the ‘SK’
or export variants were delivered to Czechoslovakia, negotiations with
China are still ongoing but it is unlikely they will be concluded for
some time. The transfer took place in early 1993 with flight training in
the USSR, there are several Soviet pilots on staff with the Squadron to
assist with advanced training and tactics but there are no two seat
training aircraft available and pilots need to go to the Soviet Union
for qualification and re-certification if needed. Although capable of
air to ground missions, these aircraft are used primarily in the air
defence role as part of the 11<sup>th</sup> Fighter Regiment along with
the
MiG-29s.

**MiG-29**

Originally 20 of these high performance multi-role aircraft were
delivered by 1991; this number included two MiG-29UB 2-seat trainers.
Since this time four more aircraft were delivered and they were
consolidated into two squadrons of the 11<sup>th</sup> Fighter Regiment.
Together with the Su-27s these aircraft represent a massive improvement
in capability from the 1980’s and provide a real threat to NATO
aircraft.

**MiG-23**

The Czechoslovakian air force has a mix of air superiority and ground
support variants and has concentrated these aircraft into two units. Two
Northern Fury events have augmented the Czech holding of this type.
Originally there were 32 modern ‘BN’ (NATO name Flogger H) variants used
for ground support and that remains extant; however, in the
1<sup>st</sup> Fighter Regiment there were 36 older ‘MF’ (Flogger B) air
superiority fighters and about a dozen modern ‘ML’ (Flogger G) types.
With the unification of Germany there were surplus MiGs-23s available
which were more recent than those in use so a deal was cut where enough
Flogger G’s were provided to outfit two squadrons while the other two
squadrons stayed with the Flogger B’s. Finally in 1993, as part of the
deal with the Soviet Union both of the Flogger B squadrons were to be
updated to the very latest ‘MLD’ (Flogger K) in exchange for the older
airframes, only one squadron has completed the exchange by the time
Northern Fury
starts.

**MiG-21**

Over 260 MiG-21s remain in service in the Czechoslovakian air force,
from the antique MiG-21F-13s (Fishbed C) still used in training through
the second (Fishbed D & F) and third generation (Fishbed J) of these
ubiquitous aircraft. The Czechoslovak uprising in 68 probably had
something to do with none of the later types being in use, but those
that are in service are used for all roles, training, reconnaissance,
air superiority and ground attack, although these latter two roles would
be quite risky against modern NATO
fighters.

**Su-22**

Historically, Czechoslovakia acquired 49 Su-22M4 and 8 two seat
Su-22UM3Ks in 1992, these are the very latest in this family of Fighter
Bomber and in Northern Fury this acquisition has been increased to 65
single and 10 double seat versions. Negotiations are ongoing for an
additional 32 airframes to replace the remaining MiG-21s in the
6<sup>th</sup> Fighter/Bomber Regt and round out a third squadron in the
20<sup>th</sup> Fighter/Bomber Regt. The trickle-down effect of this
proposed acquisition is the retirement of the Fishbed D’s in the
Force.

**Su-25**

To fulfill the close support ground attack function in close cooperation
with army units, Czechoslovakia, as well as most other WP countries,
acquired the Su-25, the Soviet equivalent to the American A-10 Warthog.
In the late ‘80s the Soviets produced well over 1000 of these aircraft
and 36 Su-25K were sent to the Czechs, plus two dual control trainers
(Su-25UBK). In Northern fury Soviet production of the Su-25T was
increased and some of the older Su-25Ks were distributed to WP
countries, in this case an additional 12 were provided, adding a third
squadron to the
ORBAT.

[**L-29 Delfin /L-39 Albatros**](http://www.airvectors.net/avl39.html)

![](/assets/images/warsaw/cz/air/image7.jpg)These Czechoslovakian
designed and produced aircraft became the standard training aircraft
throughout the Warsaw Pact and beyond, with many going to African and
Asian WP aligned countries. The L-39ZA was an improved design able to
conduct advanced training, light conduct ground attack and
reconnaissance. The next evolution of this aircraft was the L-39MS (the
‘M’ variant was not produced) which was produced starting in 1989,
real life intervened causing production to cease early but in Northern
Fury this doesn’t happen and 24 were produced for the Czechoslovak Air
Force by the start of 1994 in addition to sales to Egypt, Tunisia and
other WP
countries.
