**Czechoslovakia** is one of the five remaining countries forming the
Warsaw Pact, a situation that is complicated by over 500,000 Soviet
troops currently stationed in a country about the same geographic size
as the US state of Mississippi. Most of these troops came from their
previous station in the former East Germany but also includes the 85,000
troops of the Soviet Central Group of Forces (CGF) which have been in
Czechoslovakia since re-occupying it in 1968. To the Czechoslovak
people, who had a small glimmer of freedom in 1989, this is seen as an
army of occupation, but the Czechoslovakian Army is kept in line by
improved training and equipment while the government is essentially held
hostage.

The Czechoslovakian Peopleâ€™s Army (CVA) forms the bulk of the defense
forces with only a riverine navy designed to assist Soviet Logistics
efforts, and a moderately sized air force of about 400 combat aircraft.
