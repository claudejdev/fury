**Romanian Navy**

The Romanian navy, is a small coastal defence force but supporting a
domestic ship building capability. The main role of the navy was to
support the Soviet Black Sea Fleet in times of crisis but a critical
secondary role was the riverine elements along the Danube River. The
Danube is a critical element in the resupply of the Army units that
deploy westward into Balkans, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and even Germany.
This page will be limited to the Black Sea flotilla, and will leave the
river flotilla for later development.

The fleet is based in two Black Sea locations; Constanta, and Mangalia
with the Frigate and submarine based at the former and the corvettes at
the later.

**Frigate**

The flagship of the Romanian navy is the locally designed and built
[Mărășești](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_frigate_M%C4%83r%C4%83%C8%99e%C8%99ti).
Initially commissioned in ’86 the ship has spent half its life in refit
to address design problems and is now christened with its third name,
and third classification. As a Frigate, this is a marginally capable
ship, it has outdated Surface to Surface missiles and SAMs, is slow by
most standards and very large for its type.

**Corvettes**

Tetal Class. Another home grown design, these ships have no missiles and
focus on ASW operations. The Tetal-II sub class has one gun turret
removed and replaced by a helicopter landing deck.

**Missile Boats**

**[Tarantul
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_12411.htm)**
The Romanian Navy received three of this class from 1990-92 from the
Soviet Back Sea Fleet. With 4x P-15M (S-N-2C) Styx, Surface to Surface
Missiles (SSM) and high speed (42 Knts), this is a potent little ship,
weighing in at 495 tons.

| Class      | Pennant | Name       | Status | Remarks |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------ | ------- |
| Tarantul I | F-188   | Zborul     | Active |         |
|            | F-189   | Pescăruşul | Active |         |
|            | F-190   | Lăstunul   | Active |         |

**[Osa
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_205.htm)** The
Romanian Navy took delivery of three Osa I and three Osa II boats. The
main improvement between the two sub classes was an improved version of
the P-15 (S-N-2C) Styx SSM. All were based at Atia. The Osa I boats are
in reserve and will take several days to activate.

| Class  | Pennant | Name       | Status  | Remarks      |
| ------ | ------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Osa I  | F-195   | Vulturul   | Reserve | Project 205  |
|        | F-198   | Eretele    | Reserve |              |
|        | F-199   | Albatrosul | Reserve |              |
| Osa II | F-202   | Smeul      | Active  | Project 205U |

**ASW Corvettes**

**[Poti Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warships/project_204.htm)**
These rugged little ships provided excellent service and had a good ASW
suite in a small package. The Romanian Navy operated three of these
ships.

| Class | Pennant | Name | Status | Remarks |
| ----- | ------- | ---- | ------ | ------- |
|       | MPK-31  |      | Active |         |
|       | MPK-32  |      | Active |         |
|       | MPK-33  |      | Active |         |

**Submarines**

**[Delfinul (Kilo)
Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_submarine_Delfinul)**
Romania has one submarine of the very capable and dangerous Kilo class.
In the shallow waters of the Black sea and the confined space of the
shipping lanes, this is a very potent threat, particularly to Turkish
naval units.
