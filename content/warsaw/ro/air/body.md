**Romanian Air and Air Defence Forces**

The Romanian Air Force operates about 270 front line combat aircraft, 40
helicopters, 20 transport and about 100 training aircraft as well as
many air defence missile systems. Although mostly dated by 1994, there
is a thriving domestic aviation industry which produces Mi-8/17
helicopters and IAR-93 ground attack aircraft. The primary focus of the
air force is to support the Army in its dual role of reinforcing
Bulgaria to the south and Hungary to the northwest. There are no Soviet
air elements hosted in Romania but there are plans for immediate
reinforcement in the event of war.

**MiG-21**

These are quite dated and primarily used in the ground support role and
in follow on strikes. There are over 150 in reserve including 100 Air
Defence **MiG-21PFM** and **MiG-21PF** ‘Fishbed F’. Under development is
the MiG-21 Lancer, production and exchange of technology limitations
however will delay production into 1995.

There are three versions of 2<sup>nd</sup> generation **MiG-21s** in
service, the **MiG-21RF** Fishbed-H reconnaissance variant, nine of the
original 12 remain in service. Forming the backbone of the air force
with about half of the combat aircraft is the Fishbed-J, there are 68
**MiG-21M** and 110 **MiG-21MF** Fishbed-J in operation, 35 ‘**MF**s’
having been transferred to Romania from the former East Germany.
Additionally about 35 two seat training variants operated in the air
combat training schools, these are a mix of **MiG-21US** and
**MiG-21UM** Mongol-B, with advanced avionics. All fighter pilots spent
time on this type to learn the basics of air combat.

**MiG-23**

The Romanian air force operates one regiment of 33 **MiG-23MF**
Flogger-B in the air superiority role. Although the aircraft is capable
of air to ground operations, that is generally left to the MiG-21s.
There six of the original 10 **Mig-23UB** training versions.

**MiG-29**

The most modern and capable aircraft available is the **MiG-29A**. A
true multi-roll 4<sup>th</sup> generation aircraft able to match NATO
air superiority fighters on a nearly equal bases, the Fulcrum is very
advanced, highly maneuverable, and quite rugged. Romania received 17
Fulcrum A of which 13 remain in service plus 4 two seat ‘UB’ trainers.

**IAR-93B**

The IAR-93 Vulture is a ground attack replacement for the older MiGs in
Romanian and Yugoslav service. Designed and built in Romania (called the
Orao in Yugoslavia), these are rugged, capable aircraft. Romania
received 41 pre-production and ‘A’ variants with sub-sonic engines and
27 ‘B’ versions with afterburning engines, improved efficiency,
hard-points and several other features. There were also 15 ‘MB’ variants
with the airframe of the ‘B’ and the subsonic engines of the ‘A’. In
Northern Fury, the 15 ‘MB’s were equipped with the better engines
enabling the air force to field 42 IAR-93B.
