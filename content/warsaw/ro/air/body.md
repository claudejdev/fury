**Romanian Air and Air Defence Forces**

The Romanian Air Force operates about 270 front line combat aircraft, 40
helicopters, 20 transport and about 100 training aircraft as well as
many air defence missile systems. Although mostly dated by 1994, there
is a thriving domestic aviation industry which produces Mi-8/17
helicopters and IAR-93 ground attack aircraft. The primary focus of the
air force is to support the Army in its dual role of reinforcing
Bulgaria to the south and Hungary to the northwest. There are no Soviet
air elements hosted in Romania but there are plans for immediate
reinforcement in the event of war.

**MiG-21**

These are quite dated and primarily used in the ground support role and
in follow on strikes. There are over 150 in reserve including 100 Air
Defence **MiG-21PFM** and **MiG-21PF** ‘Fishbed F’. Under development is
the MiG-21 Lancer, production and exchange of technology limitations
however will delay production into 1995.

There are three versions of 2<sup>nd</sup> generation **MiG-21s** in
service, the **MiG-21RF** Fishbed-H reconnaissance variant, 9 of the
original 12 remain in service. There are 68 **MiG-21M** and 110
**MiG-21MF** Fishbed-J in operation, 35 ‘**MF**s’ having been
transferred to Romania from the former East Germany. The Fishbed-J forms
the backbone of the air force with about half of the combat aircraft in
use. Additionally about 35 two seat training variants operated in the
air combat training schools, these are a mix of **MiG-21US** and
**MiG-21UM** Mongol-B, with advanced avionics. All fighter pilots spent
time on this type to learn the basics of air
combat.

**MiG-23**

The Romanian air force operates one regiment of **MiG-23MF** Flogger-B
in the air superiority role. Although the aircraft is capable of air to
ground operations, this is generally left to the MiG-21s. There are 33
of the original 36 airframes available as well as 6 of the original 10
**Mig-23UB** training
versions.

**MiG-29**

As with all Warsaw Pact satellites, the most modern and capable aircraft
available is the **MiG-29A**. A true multi-roll 4<sup>th</sup>
generation aircraft able to match NATO air superiority fighters on a
nearly equal bases, the Fulcrum is very advanced, highly maneuverable,
and quite rugged. Romania received 17 Fulcrum A of which 13 remain in
service plus 4 two seat ‘UB’
trainers.

**IAR-93B**

The IAR-93 Vulture is a ground attack replacement for the older MiGs in
Romanian and Yugoslav service. Designed and built in Romania (called the
Orao in Yugoslavia), these aircraft are rugged, capable aircraft.
Romania received 41 pre-production and ‘A’ variants with sub-sonic
engines and 27 ‘B’ versions with afterburning engines, improved
efficiency, hard-points and several other features. There were also 15
‘MB’ variants with the airframe of the ‘B’ and the subsonic engines of
the ‘A’. In Northern Fury, the 15 ‘MB’s were equipped with the better
engines enabling the air force to field 42
IAR-93B.
