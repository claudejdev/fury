**Romanian People’s Army (APR)**

The Romanian Army was organized along Soviet lines but was long isolated
from the Soviet Army by Nicolae Ceausescu’s hard line economic policies.
Prohibited from importing equipment or even spare parts for existing
equipment, Romanian industry created copies – almost all of a very
inferior design, of Soviet equipment. The dissolution of Yugoslavia into
separate states and drawing NATO forces nearly adjacent to the Romanian
border was a major factor in the renewed interest of the Soviet high
command in bolstering the RPA. With the change in Soviet government in
1991, an agreement was reached where former East German equipment, which
had been temporarily held under Soviet protection, was gifted to the
Romanian People’s Army in a show of support and comradeship. Many
believe it was the support given to Ceausescu by Soviet agencies in
routing out dissident groups which convinced him to change his policy.

The long-standing plan for the APR was to maintain four Combined Arms
Armies (CAA), each roughly Corps strength by NATO standards. Romania
would not field a ‘Front’ HQ but dispatch its CAAs to support other
areas. One CAA (probably 1<sup>st</sup>) would be deployed to Bulgaria
and reinforce the Balkan Front while the other three would follow the
Czech and Hungarian forces into Germany as part of the Western Group of
Forces. It is very possible however that this overall deployment plan
has changed, and it is likely that the APR will now form a Front HQ –
probably called the Serbian Front. This new organization, reinforced by
Soviet and possibly Hungarian forces would move to prevent NATO
interference in the former
Yugoslavia.
