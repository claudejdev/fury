**Romanian People’s Army (RPA)**

The Romanian Army is organized along Soviet lines but was long isolated
from the Soviet Army by Nicolae Ceausescu’s hard line economic policies.
Prohibited from importing equipment or even spare parts for existing
equipment, Romanian industry created copies of Soviet equipment – almost
uniformly of a very inferior design. The dissolution of Yugoslavia into
separate states and drawing NATO forces nearly adjacent to the Romanian
border was a major factor in the renewed interest of the Soviet high
command in bolstering the RPA. With the change in Soviet government in
1991, an agreement was reached where former East German (DDR) equipment,
which had been temporarily held under Soviet protection, was gifted to
Romania in a show of support and comradeship. Many believe it was the
support given to Ceausescu by Soviet agencies in routing out dissident
groups which convinced him to change his policy.

The long-standing plan for the RPA was to maintain four Combined Arms
Armies (CAA), each roughly Corps strength by NATO standards. Romania
would not field a ‘Front’ HQ but dispatch its CAAs to support other
areas. One CAA (probably 1<sup>st</sup>) would be deployed to Bulgaria
and reinforce the Balkan Front while the other three would follow the
Czech and Hungarian forces into Germany as part of the Western Group of
Forces. It is very possible however that this overall deployment plan
has changed, and it is probable that Romania will now form a FRONT HQ –
perhaps called the Serbian Front. The new organization reinforced by
Soviet and conceivably Hungarian forces would move to prevent NATO
interference in the former
Yugoslavia.
