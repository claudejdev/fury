**Soviet Union**

The Strategic objective of the Soviet Union in the upcoming war is to
shatter NATO as an alliance in order to re-establish a balance of power
in Europe with the Soviet Union in the prominent role.

In order to achieve this, Soviet High Command has set these operational
level objectives:

\- Envelope Central Europe with the Northern Arm through Norway and the
Southern Arm through Germany, seizing Berlin, Copenhagen and Oslo as
bargaining chips in the process.

\- Interdict in the North Atlantic by seizing Iceland and disrupting US
reinforcements to NATO and the supply of general cargo to Western
Europe.

\- Distract and cause confusion in the Indian Ocean, Caribbean and
Mediterranean regions with a view to tying down forces that would
otherwise reinforce Europe and sewing unrest in non-aligned countries.

\- Focus attention in the Western Pacific by destabilizing South Korea,
Japan and the Philippines.

\- To remove focus from Europe the Soviets will foster unrest in Africa,
urge Argentina to re-attack the Falklands, assist North Korea hoping
they would attack South Korea, and precipitate war between India &
Pakistan.

\- Neutralize NATO's Nuclear Triad by remaining strictly conventional in
all actions, and messaging the futility and vulnerability of general
nuclear exchange through every means possible throughout the West.
