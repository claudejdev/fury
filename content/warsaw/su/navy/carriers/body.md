**Soviet Navy Aircraft Carriers**

The Soviets have had a long and difficult relationship with this class
of ship. Fundamentally it is not within Soviet Naval doctrine to engage
in power projection, but this has traditionally been the main role of an
aircraft carrier. Instead, the Soviet fleet tends to use these ships to
provide air superiority and/or anti-submarine warfare (ASW) protection
for other major units, particularly submarines and especially Ballistic
Missile Submarines (SSBN). The hard line government in northern Fury
however has other ideas; it sees the fleet as a tool to be used
aggressively to achieve strategic goals, in other words – power
projection.

[**Kuznetsov
Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/kuznetsov_class.htm)

The panicle of Soviet naval aviation is this class of two medium sized
nuclear powered carriers. They do not compare favorably to American
fleet carriers but they are much more capable than anything that
European NATO countries have. These are called Aviation Cruisers in
Russian, and that is an important distinction – they have many of the
characteristics of an air defence and ASW cruiser, and they carry
aircraft. The ship is equipped with 12 of the appropriately named

missiles, 192 Gauntlet
([SA-N-9](http://weaponsystems.net/weaponsystem/EE05%20-%20SA-15%20Gauntlet.html))
Surface to Air Missiles (SAM), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and close in
defence weapons. Aircraft include a wing of 24

superiority fighters, 8-12
[Ka-27](http://www.military-today.com/helicopters/kamov_ka27_helix.htm)
and 3 [Ka-31](http://www.military-today.com/helicopters/kamov_ka31.htm)
(often called Ka-27RLD) Airborne early warning (AEW) helicopters.
Historically the Su-33 was being developed in the late ‘80s but that was
stalled in the early ‘90s, Northern Fury has that development continuing
with 60 of them ready by 1994. Another major change in this alternate
history is the second ship in this class. The Varyag was launched in
1988 but never completed, eventually she was sold to the Chinese,
restored and entered service with them in 2012. Northern Fury has her
completed under tight security and being and unpleasant surprise for
NATO. Both ships are in the Northern Fleet and based at
Severomorsk.

[**Kiev Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/kiev_class.htm)

These four ships were very much more of a hybrid cruiser and carrier
than the Kuznetzov. Commissioned between 1975 and 1987, all were
scrapped or sold by 1993 in the real world, in Northern Fury they were
all retained. The anti-air, anti-surface and ASW armament varied between
them, to the point that some references categorize them as three
different classes. As for air groups – these were primarily ASW by
design with 16 Ka-27, including 2 or 3 AEW versions, but they also
included the [Yak-38](http://www.airvectors.net/avredvt.html) Vertical
Take Off and Landing (VTOL) fighter to provide limited strike and air
superiority, in Northern Fury the historically canceled [Yak-41
Freestyle](http://www.military-today.com/aircraft/yak_141.htm) was also
coming on
line.

[**Moskva
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moskva-class_helicopter_carrier)

The first of the large Aviation Cruisers, the two ships of the Moskva
class were commissioned in the late ‘60s and were plagued with
mechanical and seaworthiness problems. They spent most of their life in
the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Unlike the later designs, these are
pure helicopter carriers; they only have self-defence weapons systems
and are unable to embark fixed wing aircraft, although a Yak-38 could
use the deck in emergencies. They can carry 18 helicopters a mix of the
Ka-27 and the older
[Ka-25](http://www.military-today.com/helicopters/kamov_ka25_hormone.htm).
