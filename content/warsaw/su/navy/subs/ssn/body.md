**Soviet SS/SSNs**

With well over 200 attack submarines, both nuclear and conventionally
powered Soviet Navy has more than twice as many as the US Navy and
roughly the same number as all of NATO combined. The key difference
however is that some of the submarines serving in the Soviet fleet are
old, very old – and therefore quite obsolete. At the other end of the
spectrum there are a few examples that are ultra-modern, capable of
challenging the latest western technologies; these however are quite few
in number.

**SSN**

The 73 nuclear powered boats are classified by ‘generations’: All of
1<sup>st</sup> generation (late 1950’s, early 1960’s) boats are retired
but most of the fleet, 48 boats are 2<sup>nd</sup> generation ‘Victor’
types with 11 ‘Sierra’ and ‘Alpha’ types making up the 3<sup>rd</sup>
generation and 14 variations of the ‘Akula’ 4<sup>th</sup> generation in
service. Additionally there are five ‘Yankee’ class SSNs converted from
Ballistic Missile submarines (SSBN) remaining that are held in reserve
and mothballed. The three main tasks of Soviet SSNs are to hunt NATO
submarines, interdict NATO’s Strategic Lines of Communications (SLOC)
and protect Soviet surface ships. The long endurance, relative stealth,
lethal weapon load and independence make these boats very capable
adversaries for these roles but also for information gathering,
protecting Ballistic Missile submarines (SSBN) and harassing NATO task
forces.

[**Victor
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor-class_submarine)Consisting
of three variations of the original design, the Project 671 **Shchuka**
boats are capable but have aging technologies and some of the Victor I
(15) hulls are approaching retirement age. All have the ability to
launch Torpedoes and various forms of Anti-Submarine missiles as well as
Surface to Air Missiles (SAM) to keep NATO patrol aircraft at bay. The
Victor II (7) program was terminated early after it was discovered that
they were easily trackable by US sonars. The Victor III (27) sub class
has a retractable towed array passive sonar system. One variation from
historical deployments has three additional Victor IIIs in the Northern
Fleet, re-deployed from the Pacific in the months preceding
hostilities.

[**Alpha
Class**](http://russianships.info/eng/submarines/project_705.htm)With
the exception of the single Papa Class prototype, the Project 705 ‘Lira’
class, known as Alpha Class in the west, were the fastest class of
submarines built. The radical design incorporated several innovative
technologies including a Titanium hull and liquid metal cooled reactor,
allowing for a small hull size, high speeds and deep diving depths. With
a crew of only 30-40, a speed of over 40 Knots and a diving depth
exceeding 400 Meters, these submarines sent shudders through NATO and
caused revolutionary re-designs of torpedoes, sonars and other systems
in an effort to counter this threat. In reality these boats were
difficult to maintain and operate but the technology developments were
used as a basis for the follow on Akula design. The lead boat in this
class, K-64, had a major coolant leak in 1972 resulting in superheated
liquid metal contacting cold surfaces and instantly freezing, causing
significant internal damage which was too expensive to repair, after
being broken up it became a training platform. Only six other boats were
built

[**Sierra
Class**](http://russianships.info/eng/submarines/project_945.htm)The
Project 945 Barrakuda, or Sierra class in the west was an evolutionary
design of the Victor III with technologies trialed in the Alpha. The
titanium hull allows for a deep diving depth (450M) and relatively small
crew (60-70) at speeds of 35 Knots. These are very potent adversaries
but are limited in numbers in three sub classes; two Sierra I; two
Sierra II with improved sonars and other improvements; and a single
Sierra III which historically was scrapped before completion but is in
service for Northern Fury.

[**Akula Class**](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/slbm/667AR.htm)

This is the most modern Soviet SSN, its production surprised the west
and its capabilities caused some significant concern. Designated as the
Project 971 Shchuka-B or Bars, they are collectively referred to as the
Akula in NATO. Naming is further confused as the Typhoon SSBN is called
the ‘Akula’ by the Soviets. Northern Fury accelerates production of a
couple boats by several months and the final hull, K-157 ‘Vepr’ by about
a year. The seven Akula I boats are sometimes compared to the US Los
Angeles class SSNs, while the six ‘Improved’ Akula are quieter yet and
have better sonars. The Final boat, the Akula II ‘Vepr’ has been
compared to the Improved Los Angeles class.

**SSK**

[**Echo II class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo-class_submarine)

These obsolete and accident prone boats are considered ‘First
Generation’ SSGNs. The preceding Echo I class were all retired by 1994
but all surviving Echo IIs remain active in the Northern Fury campaign.
These boats must surface to launch their missiles, and must remain in
that vulnerable state until the missiles receive mid-course guidance
updates – up to 20 minutes. Modern submariners would consider this as
suicidal. These boats have gone through a series of upgrades to carry
more modern missiles, the original boats carried eight [SS-N-3a
"Shaddock"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS-N-3_Shaddock) anti-ship
missiles, 14 were converted to carry the [P-500 Bazalt SS-N-12
"Sandbox",](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-500_Bazalt) and of five of
these (3 historically) were converted to the improved P-1000 version
with a better radar and extended range. Of the 29 boats, one has been
sunk in a collision but there have been 13 major collisions, fires, or
reactor accidents involving these boats. Three boats had been converted
to receive targeting data directly from satellites, and historically,
one of the boats was converted to support divers and Special Forces, in
Northern Fury four of the original boats have undergone this
conversion.
