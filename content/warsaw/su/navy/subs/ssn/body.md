**Soviet SSN/SSK**

With well over 200 attack submarines, both nuclear and conventionally
powered Soviet Navy has more than twice as many as the US Navy and
roughly the same number as all of NATO combined. The key difference
however is that some of the submarines serving in the Soviet fleet are
old, very old – and therefore quite obsolete. At the other end of the
spectrum there are a few examples that are ultra-modern, capable of
challenging the latest western technologies; these however are quite few
in number.

**SSN**

The 73 nuclear powered boats are classified by ‘generations’: All of
1<sup>st</sup> generation (late 1950’s, early 1960’s) boats are retired
but most of the fleet, 48 boats are 2<sup>nd</sup> generation ‘Victor’
types with 11 ‘Sierra’ and ‘Alpha’ types making up the 3<sup>rd</sup>
generation and 14 variations of the ‘Akula’ 4<sup>th</sup> generation in
service. Additionally there are five ‘Yankee’ class SSNs converted from
Ballistic Missile submarines (SSBN) remaining that are held in reserve
and mothballed. The three main tasks of Soviet SSNs are to hunt NATO
submarines, interdict NATO’s Strategic Lines of Communications (SLOC)
and protect Soviet surface ships. The long endurance, relative stealth,
lethal weapon load and independence make these boats very capable
adversaries for these roles but also for information gathering,
protecting Ballistic Missile submarines (SSBN) and harassing NATO task
forces.

[**Victor
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor-class_submarine)Consisting
of three variations of the original design, the Project 671 **Shchuka**
boats are capable but have aging technologies and some of the Victor I
(15) hulls are approaching retirement age. All have the ability to
launch Torpedoes and various forms of Anti-Submarine missiles as well as
Surface to Air Missiles (SAM) to keep NATO patrol aircraft at bay. The
Victor II (7) program was terminated early after it was discovered that
they were easily trackable by US sonars. The Victor III (27) sub class
has a retractable towed array passive sonar system. One variation from
historical deployments has three additional Victor IIIs in the Northern
Fleet, re-deployed from the Pacific in the months preceding hostilities.

[**Alpha
Class**](http://russianships.info/eng/submarines/project_705.htm)With
the exception of the single Papa Class prototype, the Project 705 ‘Lira’
class, known as Alpha Class in the west, were the fastest class of
submarines built. The radical design incorporated several innovative
technologies including a Titanium hull and liquid metal cooled reactor,
allowing for a small hull size, high speeds and deep diving depths. With
a crew of only 30-40, a speed of over 40 Knots and a diving depth
exceeding 400 Meters, these submarines sent shudders through NATO and
caused revolutionary re-designs of torpedoes, sonars and other systems
in an effort to counter this threat. In reality these boats were
difficult to maintain and operate but the technology developments were
used as a basis for the follow on Akula design. The lead boat in this
class, K-64, had a major coolant leak in 1972 resulting in superheated
liquid metal contacting cold surfaces and instantly freezing, causing
significant internal damage which was too expensive to repair, after
being broken up it became a training platform. Only six other boats were
built

[**Sierra
Class**](http://russianships.info/eng/submarines/project_945.htm)The
Project 945 Barrakuda, or Sierra class in the west was an evolutionary
design of the Victor III with technologies trialed in the Alpha. The
titanium hull allows for a deep diving depth (450M) and relatively small
crew (60-70) at speeds of 35 Knots. These are very potent adversaries
but are limited in numbers in three sub classes; two Sierra I; two
Sierra II with improved sonars and other improvements; and a single
Sierra III which historically was scrapped before completion but is in
service for Northern Fury.

[**Akula Class**](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/slbm/667AR.htm)

This is the most modern Soviet SSN, its production surprised the west
and its capabilities caused some significant concern. Designated as the
Project 971 Shchuka-B or Bars, they are collectively referred to as the
Akula in NATO. Naming is further confused as the Typhoon SSBN is called
the ‘Akula’ by the Soviets. Northern Fury accelerates production of a
couple boats by several months and the final hull, K-157 ‘Vepr’ by about
a year. The seven Akula I boats are sometimes compared to the US Los
Angeles class SSNs, while the six ‘Improved’ Akula are quieter yet and
have better sonars. The Final boat, the Akula II ‘Vepr’ has been
compared to the Improved Los Angeles class.

**SSK**

With 141 active and 54 in reserve, the Soviet Navy maintains – by far –
the largest fleet of Diesel/Electric boats in the world. Following the
Soviet penchant for keeping things beyond their time however, over half
of the active boats should be retired, and those in reserve should
probably be scrapped. Still, the 56 Kilo and Tango boats are very modern
and capable, they alone represent a significant threat the NATO both on
and under the waves.

[**Kilo Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/kilo_class.htm)

The Soviet Fleet operates a total of 38 of these very capable (Project
877) subs, a significant increase of the 24 they obtained historically.
Most of the increase was achieved through curtailing foreign sales but
also through slightly accelerating construction. The only exports
authorized were to Algeria (2), Iran (2), Poland (1), Romania (1) and
Syria (2 not historic), although many of these retained Soviet advisors.
The boats destined for India (8 by 1994), and China (2) were not
delivered or the transactions terminated in various ways. The net
difference in exports by 1994 was 8. There were also four boats
historically scrapped or not completed in 1994, and two with very slow
construction, but in Northern Fury these were completed in time for the
campaign. These are quiet, efficient boats able to use a variety of
weapons and present a significant challenge to NATO forces who often
call them the ‘Black Hole’ because they are so difficult to find.

[**Tango Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango-class_submarine)

The 18 boats of the Project 641B (Tango) class were meant as an
improvement on the previous Foxtrot class and indeed proved to be a
significantly more capable submarine. Very quiet, able to remain
submerged for more than a week before snorkeling to recharge its
batteries and with a rubber sound absorbing coating these boats were
hard to find. Coupled with improved armament, sonars, targeting systems
and communications systems, the Tango class was very capable and caused
NATO ASW forces great concern.

[**Foxtrot
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxtrot-class_submarine)

Built from 1957 until 1983 the original 58 Project 641 boats were
noisier than most contemporary submarines but capable of long distance
sustained operations. They were also slow, averaging just 2-3 knots
submerged, but could remain below the surface for almost 10 days,
impressive for the era. Four have been scrapped or sunk and the 54
remaining submarines were obsolete by the late 1970’s, even though they
were still building into 1983 and used to the year 2000.

[**Romeo Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo-class_submarine)

The Soviet Navy only operated 20 of the 133 boats of this class that
were built. Originaly planning to deploy more than 50, they were
canceled with advent of nuclear powered SSNs, but were still very useful
in the export market. Representing the ultimate evolution of the Whiskey
Class these were even more obsolete than the Foxtrot class by 1994.

[**Whiskey
Class**](http://russianships.info/eng/submarines/project_613.htm)Designed
in World War II and then influenced by captured German Type XXI U-Boats.
Called Project 613, there were five major variants and an astounding 215
built in the Soviet Union by 1958. In addition to 21 built in China and
41 exported to various countries, the Soviets were still operating 45 in
the 80s with 15 in reserve. Most were retired in 1990 but six were still
active in 1994 as well as 54 in reserve. Many boats were converted over
time to test various systems and some were converted into Guided Missile
Submarines (SSG) but the six *Whiskey Long Bin* and seven *Whiskey Twin
Cylinder*, as well as the four radar picket *Whiskey Canvas Bag*
variants were all retired. All remaining boats were a relatively
universal design with six torpedo tubes and although unlikely, some may
have had one, two or 25mm anti-aircraft guns.
