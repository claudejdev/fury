**Soviet SSG/SSGNs**

The Soviet Navy has a long history of using its submarines to deliver
guided missiles against both land and naval targets. Guided Missile
submarines (SSG) and their nuclear powered counterpart (SSGN) present a
complex threat to an adversary. Able to launch their missiles from
ranges much greater than most Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) defences,
these platforms stand a good chance of escaping undetected; while the
missiles themselves pose a significant threat they will often trigger
defensive measures that might reveal locations or gaps in defences to
other lurking threats. Against a weak or isolated foe, the missiles are
deadly, but against a well-protected adversary they will often lack the
numbers needed to penetrate the defensive screen, unless coordinated
with other attacks.

[**Oscar Class**](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/theater/949.htm)

In 1994 these were the largest guided missile submarines in the world
(until 2007) and designed specifically to attack US aircraft carrier
battle groups. These 18,000 ton boats have, as all Soviet submarines, a
double hull, an inner pressure hull and an outer, hydrodynamic hull. In
the case of the Oscar, the two hulls are separated by rubber noise
dampening material. The two nuclear reactors and steam turbines propel
the Oscar at over 30kns, at a maximum depth of over 300 and possibly as
much as 600 meters. In addition to torpedoes, the real weapons of this
monster are the 24 - [SS-N-19
Shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-700_Granit) missiles, with a
range of 380 nautical miles and a 750Kg (1653 lbs) warhead. There are
two versions of the Oscar – the Soviet named ‘Project 949 Granit’, or
‘Oscar I’ with two examples and the ‘Project 949A Antey’ or ‘Oscar II’
which is 10 meters longer, the space allowing for better computing and
targeting systems , and much quieter with improved propulsion equipment
and a seven blade propeller. Historically there is debate on how many
Oscar II’s were planned but it is fairly certain that 11 were launched
with the 11<sup>th</sup> significantly delayed, and three more building
and later scrapped. In Northern Fury, the first 11 are in service with
three more building and an additional four planned. There were also a
bewildering number of name and pennant changes for these boats, the
names presented are those used in 1994 as best as can be determined.

[**Charlie Class**](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/theater/670.htm)

Considered a ‘Second Generation’ of Soviet Submarine, the Charlie class
has two main variants. The Charlie I is slightly smaller has eight
[SS-N-7
Starbright](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/theater/ss-n-7.htm) while
the Charlie II has eight of the much more capable [SS-N-9
Siren](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/theater/ss-n-9.htm) missiles.
Although these boats are much more capable than their predecessors, they
have many design flaws, are relatively noisy and can only maintain
24knts speed, insufficient to maintain pace with many of their
perspective targets. By 1994, the Charlies are not likely to be used
against US aircraft carriers, but will limit their hunting to commercial
and logistic traffic, where their lack of stealth, short ranged and
limited number of missiles may allow them to survive better.

[**Papa Class**](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/theater/661.htm)This
is a single unit class, with the design of submarine K-162 being
discouraged from using existing technologies in an effort to spur
innovation, development was a long process. Built based on a Charlie
class hull as a fast attack submarine with a titanium hull, ten [SS-N-7
Starbright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-70_Ametist) missiles mounted
forward of the sail and a new reactor set-up; she is considered a
forerunner to the Alpha and Siera SSNs, but maintains the designation
SSGN. K-162 was the fastest submarine in the world, reaching a speed of
44.7 knts. The sub was placed in reserve in during the late ‘80s and
historically was stricken shortly after that – in Northern Fury he
remains in reserve and will be recommissioned in the Northern Fleet.

<img src="/assets\images\warsaw\su\navy\subs\ssg\image4.jpg" style="width:3.41736in;height:2.5625in" />The
Yankee class was the largest class of ballistic missile submarines
(SSBN) ever built, with 34 boats, one of which sank due to a missile
fire. However, they were built in the mid 60’s and the limitations put
on the number of submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) in the
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) treaty meant that as new SSBNs
were produced the older ones needed to be retired. The Soviets felt that
the Yankee class had years of service left in the basic design so they
proceeded to convert many of them: 16 became SSNs (retired by 94), two
became sonar testbed platforms (Yankee Pod and Yankee Big Nose), one was
converted to be a mothership for
the [Paltus-class ](http://www.hisutton.com/Spy%20Subs%20-%20X-RAY.html)mini-submarines
(Yankee Stretch), one as a testbed for a cancel missile project (Yankee
Sidecar), and four (six planned) were converted to SSGNs – the Yankee
Notch or Grusha class. In Northern Fury all six Yankee Notch were
converted and they each carry 40 conventional or nuclear tipped
[SS-N-21](http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-Cruise-Missiles.html#mozTocId152650).

[**Echo II class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo-class_submarine)

These obsolete and accident prone boats are considered ‘First
Generation’ SSGNs. The preceding Echo I class were all retired by 1994
but all surviving Echo IIs remain active in the Northern Fury campaign.
These boats must surface to launch their missiles, and must remain in
that vulnerable state until the missiles receive mid-course guidance
updates – up to 20 minutes. Modern submariners would consider this as
suicidal. These boats have gone through a series of upgrades to carry
more modern missiles, the original boats carried eight [SS-N-3a
"Shaddock"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS-N-3_Shaddock) anti-ship
missiles, 14 were converted to carry the [P-500 Bazalt SS-N-12
"Sandbox",](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-500_Bazalt) and of five of
these (3 historically) were converted to the improved P-1000 version
with a better radar and extended range. Of the 29 boats, one has been
sunk in a collision but there have been 13 major collisions, fires, or
reactor accidents involving these boats. Three boats had been converted
to receive targeting data directly from satellites, and historically,
one of the boats was converted to support divers and Special Forces, in
Northern Fury four of the original boats have undergone this conversion.

This class of 16 conventionally powered boats are the only SSG remaining
in service, all of the Whiskey class conversions have been retired.
Built to compensate for the slow design and construction of the Echo I
and II classes, the Julietts are well past their prime and historically
were all stricken between 1991 and 1994. They are able to fire Four
