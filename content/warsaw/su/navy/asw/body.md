**Soviet** **Littoral ASW Ships**

<img src="/assets\images\warsaw\su\navy\asw\image1.jpeg" style="width:2.36042in;height:1.55556in" />The
Soviet Navy relied heavily on small ships for coastal defence and
littoral Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW) patrols. These ships are generally
between 250 and 1000 tons and are suitable only for coastal duties under
friendly air cover. Although most of these ships are considered
Corvettes by traditional measure, the Soviets call them ‘Small
Anti-Submarine Ship’ (‘Maly Protivolodochny Korabl' MPK).

[**Grisha Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grisha-class_corvette)

This class of ASW corvette was built in five different versions. All of
the Grisha I ships were retired but there are 82 of the other four
sub-classes in operation. All are about 1000 tons, with a crew of 60 and
a top speed of 34 knots.

| Class      | Total | Northern | Pacific | Black Sea | Baltic | Guns      | SAM        | Remarks   |
|------------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Grisha II  | 17    | 7        | 4       | 4         | 2      | 2x2 57mm  | none       |           |
| Grisha III | 34    | 16       | 8       | 5         | 5      | Twin 57mm | 20x SA-N-4 | 30mm CIWS |
| Grisha IV  | 1     | 1        |         |           |        | Twin 57mm | 24x SA-N-9 | 30mm CIWS |
| Grisha V   | 30    | 15       | 10      | 5         |        | 1x 76mm   | 20x SA-N-4 | 30mm CIWS |

[**Pauk Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauk-class_corvette)

<img src="/assets\images\warsaw\su\navy\asw\image2.jpeg" style="width:3.58333in;height:2.6875in" />At
half the size of the Grisha class, the Pauk or Molniya-2 class have some
limitations, their Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) is active only, the air
defence is the much less capable [SA-N-5
Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K32_Strela-2), essentially a
pedestal mounted MANPADS (Man portable Air Defence System), and it only
has 1/3 the fuel range. But the ASW weapons are similar and it has both
a 76mm gun and a 30mm CIWS (Close in Weapon System). The Soviet Navy
operated 42 of these ships after transferring one to Cuba and two to
Bulgaria.

| Class | Total | Northern | Pacific | Black Sea | Baltic | Remarks |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Pauk  | 42    | 20       | 8       | 6         | 8      |         |

[**Parchim II
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchim-class_corvette)

<img src="/assets\images\warsaw\su\navy\asw\image3.jpg" style="width:3.94028in;height:1.77986in" />These
ships did not fit into the Soviet plan for ASW ships but were purchased
from and built in East Germany, essentially subsidizing this class for
the DDR. They are 800 tons, with a crew of 80, double the complement of
a Pauk and larger than the Grisha. These ships have the same guns as the
Grisha and the same air defence as the Pauk – the weaker in both cases.
They do have an active/passive VDS similar t the Grisha with similar ASW
armaments.

| Class      | Total | Northern | Pacific | Black Sea | Baltic | Remarks |
|------------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Parchim II | 12    | 6        |         |           | 6      |         |

[**Stenka
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenka-class_patrol_boat)

Called an ASW patrol boat, these are built on the same hull as the
famous Osa class missile boats. At only 180 tons with a crew of 32 these
potent little ships have the same VDS as the Grisha class and can engage
with torpedoes, depth charges or machine guns. Its only air defence
however is two 30mm CIWS Gatling guns. Of the 117 built, nine have been
transferred (4 to Cuba, 5 to Cambodia), only five of the remaining are
operated by the Navy and the remainder are operated by the KGP Maritime
border guard (Coast Guard).

| Class  | Total | Northern | Pacific | Black Sea | Baltic | Remarks |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Stenka | 108   | 50       | 34      | 12        | 12     |         |
