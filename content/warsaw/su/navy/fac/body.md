Soviet Fast Attack Craft (FAC)

Small, fast, agile, cheep to produce and deadly are the bywords of FACs
and the Soviets pioneered the type with the venerable [Komar
class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komar-class_missile_boat) which
became the first platform to sink a warship with missiles (Israel’s
Destroyer Eilat in 1967). These boats are widely exported and used in
all fleets of the Soviet Navy.

[**Osa Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osa-class_missile_boat)

<img src="/assets\images\warsaw\su\navy\fac\media\image1.jpg" style="width:4.14028in;height:1.72847in" />Over
400 of these boats were built and another 120 of the same design in
China. The Osa was a significant improvement over the, now retired Komar
class, it had a steel hull and was much more seaworthy, it carried four
missiles (vice two in the Komar) and varous forms of self defence
weapons. These 230 ton boats could reach 40knts and packed a very solid
punch. By 1994 the Soviets had sold many of their Osa boats off to
sympathetic countries, but they also shared the hull with Stenka ASW
boats many other designs were based on this boat.

Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantul-class_corvette)

These 500 ton boats are based on the Pauk class hull, are capable of
36-42knts and have a crew of 50. Equipped with a [76mm AK-176
gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-176), two [AK-630 30mm
CIWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-630) and
[SA-N-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K32_Strela-2) SAMs for air
defence, these ships have much better survivability than the Osas. There
were four versions of this class, 21 of the 22 Tarantul-I were sold to
Bulgaria, Egypt, India, Viet Nam, Poland and Rumania, with one being
kept for training. The 14 Tarantul-II each have four P-20 ‘Improved
Styx’ missiles with a 45nm range and can achieve 36knts.

There were two major variants of the Tarantul-III, all could achieve a
42knt speed with greatly improved engines and had improved electronic
counter measures (ECM). The major difference is that the 24 Tarantul-III
carried four [P-80 Zuber/SS-N-22
Sunburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS-N-22) missiles, while the 34
Tarantul-IIIM used the improved [P-270
Moskit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-270_Moskit) version of the
Sunburn.

| Class          | Total | Northern | Pacific | Black Sea | Baltic | Missile  | Remarks |
|----------------|-------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Tarantul-II    | 14    | 4        | 4       | 4         | 2      | 4x P-20  |         |
| Tarantul-III   | 24    | 8        | 6       | 2         | 8      | 4x P-80  |         |

[**Nanuchka
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanuchka-class_corvette)

At 600 tons these ships were similar but larger than the Tarantuls and
based around six [P-120 Malakhit (SS-N-9
Siren)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-120_Malakhit). Versions of this
ship built for export had the much less capable [P-15 Termit (SS-N-2
Styx)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-15_Termit) missile used on the
Osa boats. The Soviets used the Nanuchka I and III both of which had the
[SA-N-4 (Gecko)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K33_Osa) SAM, the key
difference between the two was the gun, a [twin
57mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-257) in the Nanuchka I and a
[76mm AK-176 gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-176), supported by a
[AK-630 30mm CIWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-630) in the Nanuchka
III. The export version was the Nanuchka II. In total there were 48
built (including 1 historically canceled) with ten Nanuchka II being
exported and Nanuchka I one sunk by accidental missile fire. A single
[Nanuchka IV](http://www.ww2.dk/new/navy/nanuchka4.htm) was built as a
testbed for the [P-160 Oniks
(SS-N-26)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-800_Oniks) missile.

[**Bora
Class**](http://survincity.com/2013/07/rocket-hovercraft-simoom/)This is
a class of missile hovercraft that was caught up in the disintegration
of the Soviet Union and were never produced in numbers although
considered quite
[successful](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9aky4y/russia-is-using-guided-missile-hovercraft-to-help-blockade-crimea).
Built on a catamaran hull, the ship appears to be more of a surface
effects or hydrofoil design then hovercraft but the designation. While
historically only two of these craft were built, and very slowly – in
Northern Fury there are eight with several more building. These 1000 ton
ships can travel as fast as 55knts but cruise at 12. They carry eight
[P-270 Moskit SS-N-22
Sunburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-270_Moskit) anti-ship missiles,
[9K33 Osa SA-N-4 Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K33_Osa) SAMs, a
[76mm AK-176 gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-176), and two [AK-630
30mm CIWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-630). In Northern Fury they
are evenly split between the Black and the Baltic Sea fleets.

is difficult to determine if this Ground Effects Vehicle is a [ship or
an
aircraft](https://gizmodo.com/this-caspian-sea-monster-was-a-giant-soviet-spruce-go-1456423681)
but its unique design seems to fit best here. The KM-08, or Duck as NATO
called it is a high speed strike vehicle that can travel at 300knts and
deliver six [P-270 Moskit SS-N-22
Sunburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-270_Moskit). Historically only
two were built by the time that the Soviet Union collapsed but in
Northern fury 12 of them have formed a potent squadron in the Black Sea
Fleet. They are quite susceptible to rough weather.
