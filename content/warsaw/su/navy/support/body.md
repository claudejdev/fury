**Soviet Support Ships**

The ships listed here are a representation of the more important support
ships operated by the Soviet Navy in Northern Fury. Additionally, there
are literally hundreds of smaller tenders, barges, service ships and
tugs which are not shown. Many ships are simply listed by their Project
number – a catalogue of ships can be found
[here](http://russianships.info/eng/support/) but there are gaps even in
this extensive listing.

[**Mikhail Kalinin-class passenger
ship**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Kalinin-class_passenger_ship#Ocean_liners/cruise_ships_of_the_project_101/Seefa_340):
There are 14 of the original 19 project 101 small passenger liners still
in service and are used to move troops around the USSR and the world
when needed. Each has the capacity for 333 passengers, but are not meant
for amphibious operations, although they could be used for follow up
forces.

[**Altay Class Medium
Tanker**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altay-class_oiler): Only six
ships of the Project 160 class were procured for the Soviet Navy, but
some 60 were built for the merchant fleet and can be absorbed into the
military if needed. By NATO standards these are small tankers but they
can conduct Replenishment at Sea (RAS) with one ship at a time either
over the side or from the stern.

[**Khobi Class
Tanker**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khobi-class_tanker): The Soviet
Navy operated 20 of these Project 437N small tankers built in the 1950’s
until two were exported to Albania and another to Indonesia while two
more was paid off. The remaining 15 are able to refuel one other ship at
a time but not at sea.

[**Telnovsk
Class**](http://www.wesworld.jk-clan.de/index.php?page=Thread&threadID=10573):
Medium dry cargo transport, Project 650. Built in Bulgaria there were 19
ships built, two were scrapped, one was sunk and used as the base of a
pier on Shikotan Island and another was sunk for the filming of a movie.
Ten were converted for Hydrographic survey (one scrapped and another
re-converted); two were converted to cable laying ships (one scrapped
one remaining), one was converted for nuclear transport, another for
Hydroacoustics research, and one was re-converted to a diver support
ship. The four remaining are in service to supply garrisons and ships
abroad.
