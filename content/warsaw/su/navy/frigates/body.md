**Soviet Navy Frigates**

Soviet naval doctrine stresses the need for Submarine and Anti Submarine
Warfare (ASW) in an effort to protect Ballistic Missile Submarines in
arctic and Northern Pacific waters, this in order to preserve their
nuclear options. A key factor in that doctrine are groups of ASW ships
both in littoral waters and in the open ocean. Frigates, or in Russian
‘Guard’ or ‘Escort’ or ‘Sentry’ ship, essentially the same role, size
and armament as western or other Frigates conduct this task in open
water. Although the Neustrashimyy class is leading the Soviets into a
new age, the Krivak is the mainstay of this type and can be found either
protecting larger ships from, or hunting, submarines.

Class**](https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/neustrashimy/)

This class was intended to be a modern replacement for the Krivak class
Frigates, seven were planned but the fall of the Soviet Union disrupted
those plans. In Northern Fury however six of these ships have been
commissioned into service. Equipped with excellent sonar and ASW
equipment, 16 [SS-N-25 Uran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-35)
(Switchblade) SSMs, 32 [SA-N-9
Gauntlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_missile_system) SAMs, and
the [SA-N-11 Grison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashtan_CIWS) air
defence gun/missile air defence system, these ships are a significant
step forward in both technology and capability. These ships have a
hangar and operate a Ka-27 ASW
helicopter.

Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krivak-class_frigate)

This was a highly successful class of ship has two primary users, 32
were built, in two versions for the Navy while another nine were built
for the Coast Guard. The Krivak I, and Krivak II built for the navy in
the ‘70s and ‘80s are primarily ASW ships, the Kivak II replaced the two
twin 76mm guns with single 100mm turrets and has an improved Variable
Depth Sonar (VDS). Eight (historically 4) of the Krivak I’s have been
modernized to carry the SS-N-25 Switchblade SSM, new radar, sonar and
ECM equipment and are called Krivak IVs. The nine ships of the Krivak
III sub-class are quite different, the SS-N-14 ASW missiles are removed,
they only have a single 100mm gun which is move to the bow, and they
have a helicopter deck and hangar, they were operated by the KGB
Maritime Border
Guard.
