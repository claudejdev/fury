**Soviet Navy Cruisers**

Cruisers are key warships in the Soviet Navy’s arsenal; they provide
both area air defence with Surface to Air Missiles (SAM) and area
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) systems and striking power in the form of
Surface to Surface missiles (SSM). These ships often act as flagships of
ASW groups or Surface Action Groups (SAG) but are fully capable of
operating alone in low threat enviornments.

three impressive ships are literally in a class of their own. They were
slightly smaller than the US Navy’s Iowa class Battleships, only half
the displacement, but much more modern and significantly more capable of
surviving. These nuclear powered ships were designed to do two things;
hunt and kill American aircraft carriers, or conduct commerce raiding on
a grand scale. With 20 Shipwreck
([SS-N-19](http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-Cruise-Missiles.html#mozTocId109867))
missiles capable of engaging out to 300 nautical miles with a 750kg
(1,650lb) conventional or a nuclear warhead, the idea is to hit hard and
withdraw. If attacked the Kirov class is more than capable of defending
itself with three layers of air defence: 96x
[SA-N-6](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/airdef/s-300pmu.htm) area air
defence SAMs, 128x
[SA-N-9](http://www.military-today.com/missiles/tor.htm) short range
SAMs, and 40x
[SA-N-4](http://weaponsystems.net/weaponsystem/EE05%20-%20SA-8%20Gecko.html)
point defence SAMs as well as six Close in Weapons System (CIWS)
[Kashtan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashtan_CIWS) gun/missile
systems. These ships will normally operate three Ka-27 helicopters, when
operating separate from air support one of these will be an AEW variant.
A fourth ship is under construction but will be at least a year before
commissioned (Yuri Andropov, named Petr Veliky by Russia). Although
these ships will often lead powerful SAGs, when combined with an
aircraft carrier, their ability to penetrate NATOs defences is greatly
improved with the added air superiority cover.

[**Slava Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/slava_class.htm)

Designated at Missile Cruiser these ships are powerful, adaptable and
have significant armament. They are designed to replace many of the
older Kynda and Kresta classes but are much more formidable. The primary
offensive weapons system is the
[SS-N-12](http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-Cruise-Missiles.html#mozTocId225318)
Sandbox, with 16 of these able to reach 550 nautical miles. Defensively,
the Slava class is only marginally less capable than the Kirov class
fielding a mix of 64x

defence SAMs, and 40x
[SA-N-4](http://weaponsystems.net/weaponsystem/EE05%20-%20SA-8%20Gecko.html)
point defence SAMs as well as six CIWS gun systems. They carry one Ka-27
helicopter and have an impressive ASW suite of sensors and weapons. The
original Soviet plan was to build 20 of these ships which were reduced
to four. In Northern Fury there has been a reduction but to 12 hulls,
six of which have already been commissioned.

[**Kara Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara-class_cruiser)

This seven ship class entered service in the mid ‘70s and were
essentially a gas turbine powered version of the previous Kresta II
class with improved air defences. The ships have substantial ASW
capabilities but by 1994 it is quite dated, although some carry the
newer Ka-27 vice the Ka-25 helicopter. These are potent air defence
ships, six of the class have a mix of [SA-N-3
Goblet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-11_Shtorm) (80 missiles) and
[SA-N-4 Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K33_Osa) (40 missiles)
SAMs, while the Azov was the testbed for the SA-N-6 Grumble (24
missiles) in addition to the standard suite. These ships form the core
of the Black Sea Fleet and all are still in service in the Northern Fury
world.

II Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kresta_II-class_cruiser)

These 10 ships were fitted to be an ASW variant of the Kresta I class.
They were completed in the early to mid ‘70s and are all still in
service for Northern Fury. Equipped with the new (for the time) [SS-N-14
Silex](https://everything2.com/title/SS-N-14+Silex) ASW system, and
[SA-N-3 Goblet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-11_Shtorm) (40 missiles)
air defence SAM, these were quite capable for the time. They operated
one Ka-25 helicopter primarily for ASW work.

[**Kresta I**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kresta_I-class_cruiser)

This class was originally intended to have 21 ships but the Navy’s
priorities changed in the late ‘60s and the ship was redesigned
resulting in the ASW focused Kresta II. The focus for the Kresta I was
Anti-surface warfare, but the SSM intended for the class (SS-N-12) was
not ready and they were fitted with four [SS-N-3
Shaddock](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/theater/ss-n-3.htm) SSMs.
They were equipped with 44 [SA-N-1
Goa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-125_Neva/Pechora) SAMs which were
completely inadequate by 1994. A Ka-25B helicopter was carried for
targeting. ASW defences were limited to hull mounted sonar and
torpedoes.

[**Kynda**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynda-class_cruiser)

Developed in the late ‘50s and commissioned in the early ‘60s these
ships were the Soviet Navy’s first missile cruisers and represented a
significant leap in capability. By 1994, although all four are still
serving, they are long overdue for retirement. They have a similar
armament to the Kresta I but no helicopter and older sonar. They are
able to fire eight Shaddock missiles then reload for another volley,
unfortunately with only 16 SA-N-1 SAMs they may not have a chance. The
Grozny is the Flagship of Baltic Fleet.
