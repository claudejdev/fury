**Soviet Navy Destroyers**

The Soviet navy has a large fleet of destroyers, three of the four
classes fit the Soviet classification of Large Anti Submarine Warfare
(ASW) ships ('bolshoy protivolodochny korabl' or BPK) while the
Sovremennys are classified as a true Destroyer because of its anti-ship
role (Squadron Mine Vessel ‘Eskadrenny Minonosets’ EM). By most
standards however they are classed as Destroyers based on their size,
role and weapon suite. All classes are well rounded ocean going ships
with the capacity to lead small task groups or form part of an escort
for a carrier or battle cruiser. All have an ASW capability but the
Udaloy is the master of this domain, while all have some form of anti
surface capability, even if simply guns, but the Sovremenny is the best
for this task. All have some form of air defence missile capability but
the two older classes are very vulnerable due to the age and technology
of their defensive systems. In total there are 60 Destroyers in the
fleet, and 38 of them are very modern and potent units.

Class**](https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/sovremenny/)

This is a modern, highly capable destroyer which focuses on the
anti-ship and anti-air defences of a task group while augmenting the
Udaloy class ships in the anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role. The key
weapons for anti-ship strikes are the eight [SS-N-22
Sunburn](https://everything2.com/title/SS-N-22+Sunburn) (P-80 Zubr)
hypersonic SSM (Surface to Surface Missile), with a range of 60 nautical
miles (130Km) and a 660lb (300Kg) warhead traveling at Mach 2.5. The
later ships of this class (hull \# 15 and onward) use the SSN-N-22M
(P-270 Moskit) which increases the range to 130 nautical miles (240Km).
Air defence is achieved by three layered systems; primarily the [SA-N-7
Gadfly](http://www.military-today.com/missiles/buk.htm) Surface to Air
Missile (SAM) (48 missiles), two twin turret 130mm dual purpose guns,
and finally by four Close in Weapons System (CIWS) 30mm Gatling guns.
ASW is a secondary role of these ships and is accomplished with hull
mounted sonar, a Ka-27 helicopter and a mix of ASW rocket launchers and
torpedoes. All 23 of these ships are in service by the start of Northern
Fury, although this is a [more
aggressive](https://www.forecastinternational.com/archive/disp_old_pdf.cfm?ARC_ID=1787)
schedule than existed, there are four more building of a planned 32
ships.

Class](http://www.military-today.com/navy/udaloy_class_destroyer.htm)**

The Udaloy class specialize in ASW, they have an excellent Variable
Depth Sonar (VDS) suite, potent long and short range ASW weapons and two
Ka-27 helicopters. These ships are designed to lead ASW hunter groups or
lead the escort of a major formation protecting either a Kuznetzov class
aircraft carrier or Kirov class Battle Cruiser. They have good air
defence capability with 64 [SA-N-9
Gauntlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_missile_system) SAMs and
four CIWS 30mm Gatling guns. A sub class is the **Udaloy II**, much
improved overall; it has [SS-N-22
Sunburn](https://everything2.com/title/SS-N-22+Sunburn) (P-270 Moskit)
hypersonic SSMs similar to a modified Sovremennyy; an improved close ASW
capability with the
[UDev-1](http://www.harpoondatabases.com/encyclopedia/Entry3163.aspx)
system; and also adds the SA-N-11 close defence SAM. Many references
consider the Udaloy II a separate class. Overall 12 Udaloy I and three
Udaloy II are in service at the start of Northern Fury.

[**Kashin Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/kashin_class.htm)

Commissioned from the mid ‘60s to the mid ‘70s these ships were the
first in the Soviet Union to have a full Nuclear, Biological, Chemical
(NBC) defence system and the first to carry a helicopter, they were also
the first gas turbine ships in the world. The 19 of the original 20
ships were fitted with [SA-N-1
Goa](https://www.armyrecognition.com/russia_russian_missile_system_vehicle_uk/sa-3_goa_s-125_neva_pechora_ground_to_air_missile_system_technical_data_sheet_specifications_uk.html)
SAMs (32 missiles), guns and ASW weapons but the final ship
(*Sderzhanny*) had a lengthened hull, a VDS and helicopter facilities
added, and four SS-N-2C Styx SSM. Five other ships were upgraded to this
standard and called the Kashin Mod subclass. The Kashin Mod can carry a
Ka-25 ASW helicopter but do not have a hanger for extended deployments.
In 1990 the
*[Smetivy](http://www.kchf.ru/eng/ship/largeaswdestroyers/smetlivy.htm)*
was converted to the testbed for the [SS-N-25
Uran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-35) (Switchblade) SSMs, the
conversion was completed in ’93. These ships have had a long and
interesting career, with the exception of the *Otvazhny* which sank in
the black sea in 1974 and the *Smely* which was sold to Poland as the
*Warszawa* they all remain in service.

[**Kanin
Class**](https://www.onwar.com/weapons/warships/boats/Kanin-class-destroyer.html)

The Soviet navy’s first guided missile destroyers, these ships were
designed in the late ‘50s as anti surface ships and housed two SS-N-1
Scrubber launchers with six reloads each for a total of 14 missiles.
This missile however was a disappointment and the ships were converted
to general ASW destroyers in the Mid ‘60s, given a hull mounted sonar,
SA-N-1 SAMs (32 missiles), two quadruple 57mm guns and a helipad to
support a Ka-25 helicopter. Four of the original eight ships survive but
they are relegated to second line duties.
