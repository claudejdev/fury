**Intelligence Gathering Ships (AGI)**: The Soviet Navy uses
intelligence gathering ships (*SSV **S**udno **SV**yazyy –*
Communications Vessel) extensively around the world to gather electronic
signatures on NATO and other ships, aircraft and land facilities. Most
of the smaller ships were converted ocean going trawlers and they would
often shadow NATO task forces, but could not keep up if evasive measures
were taken. The larger ships would be at sea for considerable periods of
time collecting and transmitting intelligence back to the Soviet Union
for analysis.

**Libau Class, Project 357**: Communications Ship, and Training ship –
292 tons, 18 ships built in the 1950’s, about half in reserve.

[**Mayak Conversions
Project 502**](http://soviet-trawler.narod.ru/pages/ussr/foto_mayak_rzk.html):
Small Intelligence Ships – 900 Tons, at least 26 built; however, some
were used as Border Patrol, some as ASW and some as Refrigerated
transport ships. The most important ship of this class for Northern Fury
is the SSV Kursograf which starts the war just outside New York City
harbor.

and transmit it back to the Soviet Union via satellite link. They are
3,470 tons, armed with point defence weapons and 7 were built.

Project 1941**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_communications_ship_SSV-33):
This single ship – *SSV-33 Ural,* (a second was cancelled) class was
built on the same hull and with the same nuclear propulsion system as
the Kirov Class Battle Cruisers and was extremely expensive to operate.
At 36,500 tons she is a massive ship and capable of gathering
communications, signals intelligence, track space objects and missiles
as well as act as a communications relay station. He is armed with light
defensive guns and SAMs.
