The Soviet Navy or Red Fleet is large, about 500,000 personnel and over
1000 ships and a small air force, it is a major element in the Soviet
strategic plan in times of war. Unlike the US Navy, the Red Fleet is
broken into named and not numbered Fleets:

-   **The Red Banner Northern Fleet**; based largely on the Kola
    Peninsula and responsible for defending the Arctic sea and coastline
    as well as operations in the Atlantic Ocean. The Northern Fleet is
    that largest in the navy by a significant margin.

-   **The Red Banner Pacific Fleet**; based largely in the Vladivostok
    area but with bases on the Kamchatka Peninsula and elsewhere.
    Although it is the second largest fleet, it has a very wide
    operating area including the entire Pacific Ocean, the South China
    Sea, Indian Ocean and even ventures as far as the South Atlantic and
    Mediterranean.

-   **The Black Sea Fleet**; based in the Crimea and operating in both
    the Black and Mediterranean Seas.

-   **The Twice Red Banner Baltic Fleet**; based mostly in Kaliningrad,
    but also further north in Kronstadt and Leningrad. Primarily
    responsible for all operations in the Baltic Sea and extending into
    the North Sea in cooperation with the Northern Fleet.

-   **The Caspian Flotilla**; based at Baku and responsible for brown
    water operations on the Caspian Sea and Volga river. This is a small
    group of ships and geographically secure and convenient for
    experimentation and testing. Ships of up to 140M length can transit
    the Volga-Don Canal to gain access to the Black Sea; up to 210M
    length to access the Baltic via the Volga Baltic Waterway; or up to
    135M length for access to the Arctic via the White Sea-Baltic Canal.
    All of these waterways are integrated into the [Unified Deep Water
    System of European
    Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Deep_Water_System_of_European_Russia).
    Most of the ships in this Flotilla are small so their numbers are
    counted in with the Black Sea Fleet.

In addition to ships, the Navy structure includes [Naval
Aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Naval_Aviation) with
elements in each fleet and over 1,000 aircraft, [Naval
Infantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Infantry_(Russia))
comparable to US Marines organized into a Division in the Pacific, and
four independent Brigades as well as Naval Spetsnaz, and Coastal
Artillery forces.
