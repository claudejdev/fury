**Naval Aviation**

Similar to the US Navy (USN), the Soviets has a separate air force
dedicated to supporting the fleet. Much different to the USN however are
the roles, types and tasks of naval aviation, for the Soviets, embarked
aircraft on ships was a much smaller task because of the lesser emphasis
on aircraft carriers, the focus of Soviet Naval Aviation was finding and
sinking USN aircraft Carriers and generally supporting the fleet with
bombers, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and long range reconnaissance.
Each fleet has its own supporting aviation formation which is tailored
for the expected tasks of that fleet, using the Air Division as a common
basis, but the groupings within Regiments of that Division would often
contain a mix of airframes.

[**Red Banner Northern Fleet**](https://www.ww2.dk/new/navy/SF.htm):

The air arm of the Red Banner Northern Fleet operates over 675 aircraft
spanning a wide array of capabilities from long range reconnaissance to
shipborne ASW helicopters. Although all of the aircraft flying off the
two Kuznetzov class carriers report to Northern Fleet, the Yak-38 and
Yak-141 operating from the four Kiev class carriers report to the
311<sup>th</sup> Independent Shipborne Assault Aviation Regiment
Shipborne Aviation Squadron located in the Far East. Northern Fleet
works closely with the air element of the Baltic Fleet as well as the
6<sup>th</sup> Red Banner Air Defence Army PVO and the Leningrad
Military District air
command.

[**Twice Red Banner Baltic Fleet**](https://www.ww2.dk/new/navy/BF.htm):
This is the smallest air command in the Navy and it is much less reliant
on Long Range Aviation that the other fleets. In the confined area of
the Baltic, naval aviation is very much the junior partner and needs to
integrate its operations with the 15<sup>th</sup>, 26<sup>th</sup> and
76<sup>th</sup> Air Armies of the VVS as well as the PVO forces of
Leningrad Military District, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> Air
Defence Armies; this is a very complex air-space. Most of the
coordination is done at the **High Command of the Western Direction**
although the Baltic Fleets activities are mostly supporting the Army,
they have a focus on ASW within the Baltic and supporting amphibious
operations to allow surface forces to break out into the
Atlantic.

[**Red Banner Black Sea Fleet**](https://www.ww2.dk/new/navy/CHF.htm):
The naval aviation in the Black Sea Fleet have the difficult problem of
Turkey to deal with in its operations. Supporting amphibious operations
to break out of the Black Sea is the primary focus but providing
reconnaissance and long range aviation to units in the Mediterranean is
also a major task. In both cases close coordination is required with the
PVO 19<sup>th</sup> Air Defence Army and the 34<sup>th</sup> Air Army of
the
VVS.
