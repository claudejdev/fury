**Soviet Transport Aviation** – (VTA) – Komandovaniye
voyenno-transportnoy aviatsii.

HQ VTA reports directly to HQ of the Air Force (VVS) and is responsible
for all routine transport, both Strategic around the globe and tactical
in support of the Army or Navy. Although in peacetime this organization
controls somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 aircraft – wartime
mobilization would see this number double or even treble almost
immediately as aircraft from the state controlled airline Aeroflot were
rolled into service.

In addition to the formations listed below, each Air Army and some Air
Corps and Divisions have ‘Independent Mixed Squadrons or Regiments’,
each of these comprise of several types of transport aircraft, usually a
mix of ***An-12 Cub*** and ***Mi-8 Hip*** but often have strategic
transport and VIP aircraft as well. The Navy also operates several
transport units as does the Air Defence forces.

Although VTA formations are not assigned to subordinate areas, they are
affiliated and based on location, meant to support. 3<sup>rd</sup> Gds
Transport Division is located conveniently to transport the
76<sup>th</sup> Gds Airborne Division for instance, while 6<sup>th</sup>
Red Banner Transport Division is situated to work with the
7<sup>th</sup> Gds Airborne Division, and 12<sup>th</sup> Transport
Division is equipped to support global strategic cargo lift. The large
number of independent regiments reflects the diverse nature of the fleet
and the expansive area that needs to be covered.

Although detailed load tables are required, a rule of thumb for
para-dropping Soviet Desantniki or Airborne Forces is one regiment of
Il-76 transport aircraft for one airborne regiment. However, it takes
the better part of five regiments with some additional support to drop
an entire airborne division in one lift. Realistically three or possibly
four of the six airborne divisions could be para-dropped simultaneously
and each would likely take two lifts to complete the drop and provide
adequate resupply, depending on the distances involved and any
reinforcing troops, a divisional drop would consume a full division of
air transports for up to three days, and probably requires a regiment of
transports to provide sufficient supplies until a ground or sea link-up
is made. Therefore, para-dropping all six airborne divisions would take
the better part of a week to accomplish if they were all to be deployed
as close to simultaneously as possible. There is also an independent
unit – 345<sup>th</sup> Gds Airborne Regiment located in Georgia SSR and
a large independent Il-76 regiment (192<sup>nd</sup>) located in the Far
East, these two organizations are available to reinforce any mass
para-drops.

An interesting aspect of Soviet para-drops, they parachute armored
vehicles with the troops inside; this [quick
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpzkQeoJn7k) is dated but shows
the technique.
