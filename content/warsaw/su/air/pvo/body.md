**Soviet Air Defence Force (PVO)**

The PVO or *voyska protivovozdushnoy oborony*, otherwise known as the
***voyska PVO***, or simply the ***V-PVO*** was responsible for the
defence of Soviet airspace and in particular defence against NATO and
specifically American bombers. [In the 1980s the responsibilities were
broadened](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/agency/pvo.htm) to include
providing air superiority over concentrations of ground forces –
especially along the Army’s main axis of advance and second echelon
forces. The PVO is comprised of a significant Command & Control (C2)
structure nine Air Defence (AD) Armies and two special zones: Leningrad
Military District and the Moscow Air Defence District. Each of these
formations has an extensive C2 network, early warning radars, electronic
warfare (EW) systems, and a mix of Surface to Air Missile (SAM) units
and fighter interceptor regiments. Below is a graphical depiction of the
areas of responsibility for the AD formations in Northern Fury. In total
the PVO operated over 3,800 aircraft with 2,600 of them being
interceptors and the remainder being support, training and transport
aircraft; additionally, almost 12,000 SAM systems are in use as well as
hundreds of radar and EW sites.

Organizationally each AD Army and the two districts are tailored to its
specific task and the threats situation it faced.

**[2<sup>nd</sup> Independent Red Banner AD
Army](https://www.ww2.dk/new/pvo/2oapvo.htm):** With an HQ in Minsk this
was re-activated in 1986, probably in response to the reorganization of
forces and broadening of responsibilities, it is ideally positioned to
provide air superiority forces to any conflict with NATO. Most of the
SAMs in the Missile Brigades are of the very modern S-300 type, while it
is unlikely that US Strategic bombers would be a major threat so there
are no pure interceptors but much more agile fighter types able to
engage with F-111, Tornados or Mirage IV, eventually all of the MiG-23s
would be replaced by Su-27 but that will not happen for several years.

**[4<sup>th</sup> Independent Red Banner AD
Army](https://www.ww2.dk/new/pvo/4oapvo.htm):** Mostly responsible for
threats emanating from China, and covering a very wide area so this
force has more of an intercept role relying on MiG-25 and MiG-31 as well
as older SAM systems (SA-2, SA-5). Some older MiG-23s have been replaced
with hand-me-down MiG-25s (412<sup>th</sup> & 765<sup>th</sup> Regt).
This Army is quite dispersed so relies on Division structures rather
than more centralized Corps.

[**6<sup>th</sup> Independent Red Banner AD

complex area of any AD Army, the 6<sup>th</sup> covers Karelia facing
Finland, the Baltics and the northern approach to Moscow. Most of the
SAM systems are the most modern available and the aircraft are a mix
between fighters and interceptors. The 892<sup>nd</sup> Regt was
reactivated in 1993 and is destined to receive Su-27s but is currently
outfitted with the antiquated Su-15s.

[**8<sup>th</sup> Independent AD
Army**](https://www.ww2.dk/new/pvo/8oapvo.htm): Covering the south
western approaches over the Black Sea and threats from the Mediterranean
region, this army is unlikely to provide air superiority tasks and has
significant tactical air forces in the area able to handle any fighter
threat. Therefore the key vulnerability from this approach is cruise
missiles and potentially long range bombers coming in over Turkey. Most
of the SAM systems are the modern S-300 type but there are some older
models as well. The weakness in this formation are two regiments of
Su-15s which will offer very limited capability against a modern threat.

[**10<sup>th</sup> Independent AD
Army**](http://www.ww2.dk/new/pvo/10oapvo.htm): The AD Army with the
largest threat of defending against American bombers was the
10<sup>th</sup> maintained watch from the Kola Peninsula to the Kara
Sea, about 1,000 Km of coastline in the high Arctic on a direct route
from North America to Moscow. Relying mostly on its four regiments of
modernized MiG-31 and another four of older MiG-25. The regiment of
Su-27 will likely be involved in air superiority missions in northern
Norway and the aging Su-15s will form a backstop of questionable value
until replaced by MiG-31s in the coming year. The SAM units are all of
the most modern types and concentrated on the Kola Peninsula.

[**11<sup>th</sup> Independent Red Banner AD
Army**](http://www.ww2.dk/new/pvo/11oapvo.htm): The largest AD Army, the
11<sup>th</sup> protects the Soviet Far East from attack covering from
Vladivostok to the Bering Strait, a distance of 4,500 km, with a total
of 12 regiments of aircraft and 24 brigades or regiments of SAMs. The
threat from this axis is low however and correspondingly, over half this
force is quite dated and bordering on obsolete, the older MiG-23s are
little better as fighters than the Su-15s are as interceptors.

[**12<sup>th</sup> Independent AD
Army**](http://www.ww2.dk/new/pvo/12oapvo.htm): Concentrated in the
southern ‘Stans’ (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan)
facing Iran and Afghanistan, the primary threat facing this force is
from Pakistan as both Iran and India are allies and Afghanistan is still
in turmoil after the ten-year occupation by the Soviet Army. The two
regiments of MiG-25s however will be useful on the off chance that
American bombers attempted to infiltrate through the Hindukush
mountains. The SAM forces in this army are mostly older types.

[**14<sup>th</sup> Independent AD
Army**](http://www.ww2.dk/new/pvo/14oapvo.htm): Patrolling the Siberian
region this army is the second most likely to encounter American
Strategic bombers and is therefore equipped with very modern systems.
Three of the four MiG-31 regiments are modernized SM variants and many
of the SAM systems are S-300s. Most of this force however is deployed
far to the south, along the Trans-Siberian railway protecting the link
to the Far East from attack from both the north and China to the south.
In times of higher threat, the aircraft would deploy to a number of
dispersal bases to the north.

**[19<sup>th</sup> Independent Red Banner AD
Army](http://www.ww2.dk/new/pvo/19oapvo.htm):** Concentrated in the
Caucuses facing Turkey and Iran, this army’s role is to guard the
southern approach to Moscow by intercepting bomber and cruise missile
attacks emanating from the Mediterranean or Red Seas and perhaps from
the Indian Ocean. With seven regiments of interceptors, mostly MiG-25,
and 21 SAM brigades/regiments in a relatively small area this should not
be a problem.

[**Leningrad Military District**](http://www.ww2.dk/new/pvo/18kpvo.htm):
The Leningrad Military District is not part of the PVO, however, the
18<sup>th</sup> Red Banner Air Defence Corps does belong to the PVO. In
fact, there were several organizational changes in the 1970s and 80’s
but when the PVO re-established the 6<sup>th</sup> AD Army, the
18<sup>th</sup> AD Corps (In Northern Fury) remained in Location to
defend Leningrad and was therefore independent of any AD Army.

[**Moscow Order of Lenin Air Defence
District**](http://www.ww2.dk/new/pvo/mopvo.htm): It is probably not an
exaggeration to say that Moscow is the most heavily defended city in the
world. As a separate AD command this district is larger than most of the
AD Armies with four interceptor and six fighter regiments plus 41 SAM
brigades/regiments.
