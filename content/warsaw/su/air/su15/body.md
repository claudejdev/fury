[**Su-15 Flagon**](http://www.airvectors.net/avsu15.html#m6)

Designed as a supersonic interceptor for the Air Defence Forces (PVO),
the Flagon was produced in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970â€™s in
significant numbers (\~1,300) but not exported and retained specifically
for the Air Defence Role. About 500 remain operational in Northern Fury
with 300 in PVO regiments on secondary fronts and the remainder in
reserve, all are of the latest version the Su-15TM.
