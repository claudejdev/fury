<img src="/assets\images\warsaw\su\air\vgk\image1.jpg" style="width:13.125in;height:9.84375in" />

The long range bomber force is almost an air force of its own right,
they exist as the part of the Armed Forces (VA) of the Supreme High
Command (VGK) and because of the nuclear capability have a Strategic
Purpose (SN). Thus the VA VKG (SN), similar to the US Strategic Air
Command (SAC), operated with a degree of independence from the lager Air
Force, prior to 1980 this was a separate air force (Long Range Aviation
of the Armed Forces – DA VS) but now operates as a separate command
administered by the Air Force (VVS) and controlled by the VKG. In total
the force operates about 1,500 aircraft which includes about 1,000
bombers supported by reconnaissance, electronic warfare, and training
versions of the bombers as well as transport /assets for both cargo and
personnel. Organized into three main Air Armies and the 6<sup>th</sup>
Independent Corps the force in the Northern Fury world under the
Medvedev regime has been refreshing its skills – always present – in
using conventional rather than nuclear weapons, while maintaining its
deterrence posture.

**30<sup>th</sup> Air Army**: The smallest and most remotely located air
army, the 30<sup>th</sup> is in the Far East and is focused on strikes
in China or Japan and the Pacific. Capacity to conduct maritime strike
is a high priority as is working in conjunction with the Air Department
of the Pacific Fleet.

**46<sup>th</sup> Red Banner Air Army:** Located in the Smolensk area
west of Moscow has the most modern Soviet bomber – the Tu-160 Blackjack
– as well as some of the oldest – Tu-22KPD Blinder – and is ideally
situated to support either the conventional forces in Europe or a
strategic nuclear attack on North America. Consisting of four divisions
and 14 regiments, this is the largest of the Long Range Aviation Air
Armies.

**6<sup>th</sup> Independent Heavy Bomber Aviation Corps:** Formed the
46<sup>th</sup> Air Army in 1980 and moved into reserve status. Early
activation of this force commenced in early 1993 with staff training and
maintenance on aircraft in reserve. Units were reformed in Nov 1993
under the cover of the Soviet massive buildup and exercise to exert
pressure on Poland, there was a considerable degree of misinformation
presented and although indicators were received and noted in the west,
there was little or no reaction.
