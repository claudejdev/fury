**Soviet Long Range Aircraft**

**[Tu-160](http://www.airvectors.net/avtu160.html)**

Roughly comparable to the American B-1B, the Tu-160 Blackjack is a four
engine supersonic, variable geometry, long range bomber primarily
designed to deliver cruise missiles. Historically 32 were delivered by
1991 when production essentially stopped, in Northern Fury however they
continued to roll off the production line at a rate of 6 per year
bringing the total up to 48 by the start of the war. Initially all were
deployed to the 121<sup>st</sup> Guards Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment
at Engels Air Base but in the past few months a second Regiment
(184<sup>th</sup>) has been formed at the same base, each with two
Squadrons.

[**Tu-22M**](https://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Backfire.html)

This aircraft, the Backfire should not be confused with the Tu-22
Blinder, although they bear the same designation they are entirely
different, the Tu-22M being successful while the Blinder was much less
so. The Backfire was a two engine, supersonic, variable geometry bomber
with reasonably long range. Range is an issue with this aircraft as it
cannot compete with other strategic bombers, aimed at conducting strikes
in Europe and China, and with a limited refueling fleet, these bombers
were not very useful for strikes against North America. The first
production models were the Tu-22M2 Backfire-B with 211 built by 1983.
Following this the improved Tu-22M3 Backfire-C was introduced with
improved efficiency an increase in speed from Mach 1.65 to Mach 2.05 and
a 33% increase in range, which was still not enough to make the aircraft
universally employable. Historically 268 Tu-22M3s were built along with
12 Tu-22M3R for maritime reconnaissance and three, Tu-22MP which were
used by the navy for escort jamming. In Northern Fury production began
to accelerate slightly in 1991 and continued resulting in the numbers in
the table below. These aircraft are used both by the VVS Strategic
Bomber force and by Naval
Aviation.

[**Tu-22**](http://www.airvectors.net/avtu22.html)

The original Tu-22 Blinder entered service in 1962 and was a major
disappointment. Not only did it take almost 10 years to develop, it
never managed to replace the long serving Tu-16 Bear which is still hard
at work. Although the Blinder was not designed for intercontinental
flight, its range was disappointing; it was difficult to fly, was
riddled with mechanical problems and was not particularly fast. When the
concept of a manned bomber was put into question in the early 1960s they
were converted to missile carriers, but this too proved difficult and
problematic, in the end one AS-4 missile can be carried. The Blinder was
never adopted by the Navy which preferred the longer range and
flexibility of the long standing Tu-16. Many Tu-22s were either built or
converted into secondary roles such as reconnaissance, training, ELINT
or EW. All have been upgraded with newer electronics and fitted with a
nose probe for refueling.

[**Tu-95**](http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Bear.html#mozTocId615057)

The famous Tu-95 Bear became the symbol of Soviet global power through
most of the Cold War. Initially fielded in 1957 and its many variants
continued in production until 1994. In Northern Fury, that production
continues and there are a dozen more examples in service than there
historically were. The turbo-prop engines made for efficient and
reliable long range flight with a sizable carrying capacity. The
airframe was strong, reliable and very flexible. Over its lifetime there
were a wide array of variants, prototypes and experiments; late model
airframes were based on the Tu-142 airframe which was significantly
improved including in wing fuel tanks. Represented below are the key
examples represented in Northern
Fury.

[**Tu-16**](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/bomber/tu-16.htm)

The Tu-16 Badger is the venerable workhorse of Soviet Long Range
Aviation. Starting service in the 1950s as a free-fall bomber the Badger
has evolved into a bewildering number of variations. Although some
retain the ability to drop bombs, all strike versions are missile
carriers, especially the naval aviation versions are missile carriers
able to carry the AS-4, AS-5 and/or AS-6 missiles. The other main use
for this airframe is for reconnaissance, EW and ECM with several
different versions; these machines were undergoing constant upgrade and
modification which led to confusion in NATO and some difficulty in
categorizing these aircraft. About 800 of the 1,500 Badgers produced are
still flying for the Soviet air force. Some 60 Tu-16s were delivered to
Egypt, Iraq and Indonesia; these were surplus to requirement and all of
older types. The table below details the versions in service in Northern
Fury:

**M-4 Tanker**

The M-4 Bison has been retired as a bomber but lives on in a support
role as a tanker, extending the range of the bomber force as well as
supporting some of the more modern fighters. About 70 M-4 3MS-2 Bison-B
tankers are in service to support the fleet, not nearly enough by NATO
standards but the Soviets seem content with that number.

**Bombers in reserve**

About 500 post war Il-28 Beagles remain in reserve, mostly the basic
bomber variant but also some of the ELINT and ECM versions, although
these are now horribly obsolete.
