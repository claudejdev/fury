**Serbian Air Forces**

The Serbian Air Force operates about 200 combat aircraft, 110
helicopters, 20 transport and about 70 training aircraft as well as
dozens of air defence missile systems. In addition to being quite dated
by 1994, the Serbian Air Force was operating under very strenuous
conditions. The Yugoslav civil war had caused several units to displace
from their long standing basis, and lose of pilots and staff due to
national selection meant a drastic loss in experience. The imposition of
NATO’s Operation Deny flight meant that air support of Serbian backed
forces in Bosnia Herzegovina was severely curtailed, until this point
however many pilots in the Serbian Air Force gained some limited combat
experience.

**MiG-21**

The mainstay of the Serbian Air force is the MiG-21, well over half of
the combat force is made up from a mix of older **MiG-21PFM** ‘Fishbed
F’ and the much newer and more capable **MiG-21bis** ‘Fishbed-L’. In
addition the hundred or so combat variants, Serbia maintained 24
training and 12 reconnaissance
versions.

**J-22 Orao**

A local design in conjunction with Romania, the J-22 is light attack and
reconnaissance aircraft primarily assigned to ground support tasks. A
Squadron of 8 J-22s was left in Bosnia as part of the Republic of
Serbska air force while the remainder were withdrawn to Serbia

**MiG-29**

The **MiG-29A** arrived in Yugoslav service in the late ‘80s when they
became the first European export customer for the type. A true
multi-roll 4<sup>th</sup> generation aircraft able to match NATO air
superiority fighters on a near one to one bases, the Fulcrum was very
advanced, highly maneuverable, and quite rugged. These aircraft saw some
limited combat prior to the 1993 imposition of the No-fly zone over
Bosnia. They are used primarily in the Air Defence
role.

**G-4 Super Galeb**

Designed in Yugoslavia as a combat jet training aircraft, 79 were built
for the Yugoslav Air Force between 1984 and 1991 while a further 6 were
exported. During the civil wars these rugged and versatile aircraft were
pressed into service in the ground attack role, 3 were shot down and
several were destroyed on the ground. The Republic of Serbska holds 1 of
these while the remainder withdrew to Serbia which currently operates 40
in two squdrons.
