**Ground forces of Serbia and Montenegro (VSCG)**

The splintering of the ‘Former Republic of Yugoslavia’ (FRY) during the
‘Yugoslav Wars’ which are ongoing in Bosnia and Croatia also tore the
Yugoslav National Army (formerly JNA) to pieces. The bulk of the
organized force remains under Serbian control and has been structured
into the VSCG. This
[link](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/1993-07-01b.pdf)
provides a moderately redacted summary of the military situation as it
stood in July 93.

The key divergence from the historical occurring in the Northern Fury
world is that the influence and pressure from Moscow is even stronger
than it was. Belgrade was actively courted to re-join the Warsaw Pact,
which it did in the latter half of ‘93. NATO, very aware and concerned
over this possibility was somewhat more circumspect in its support of
the independent Slovenian and Croatian governments and is now cautiously
avoiding confrontation. UN, NATO and EU monitoring and peacekeeping
forces remain in place in both Bosnia and Croatia, but the Soviet veto
in the UN Security council has blunted the teeth of their mandates,
hence there is a much less aggressive NATO stance and reduced forces.
