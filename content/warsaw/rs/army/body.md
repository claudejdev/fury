**Ground forces of Serbia and Montenegro (VSCG)**

The splintering of the ‘Former Republic of Yugoslavia’ (FRY) during the
‘Yugoslav Wars’ which are still ongoing in Bosnia and Croatia also tore
the Yugoslav National Army (formerly JNA) to pieces. The bulk of the
organized force remains under Serbian control and has been structured
into the VSCG. This
[link](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/1993-07-01b.pdf)
provides a moderately redacted summary of the military situation as it
stood in July 93.

The key divergence from the historical occurring in the Northern Fury
world is that the influence and pressure from Moscow is even stronger
than it was. Belgrade was actively courted to re-join the Warsaw Pact,
which it is very likely to do at any moment and de-facto has in some
ways. NATO, very aware and concerned over this possibility was somewhat
more circumspect in its support of the independent Slovenian and
Croatian governments and is now cautiously avoiding confrontation. UN,
NATO and EU monitoring and peacekeeping forces remain in place in both
Bosnia and Croatia, but the Soviet veto in the UN Security council has
blunted the teeth of their mandates, hence there is a much less
aggressive NATO stance and reduced forces.

The armies of the VSCG are arrayed as depicted in the map obtained at
the CIA link above:

Structurally the VSCG is not unified, although based along Soviet
designs there is little to no consistency and the forces exhibit a wide
range of training, leadership and equipment. Some elements are battle
hardened and very capable while some, primarily in the 2<sup>nd</sup>
Army are little more than well armed gangs. Operations at higher than
Brigade level will likely be challenging. Much of the equipment of the
original JNA wound up in Serbia although there is some discrepancy and
wide variations in some areas.
