**Serbia** although not a member of the Warsaw Pact has gravitated into
the Soviet sphere as the dissolution of the former Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY) partitioned the population and geography into an
East-West divide. With Italy and Austria backing Slovenia, the US and
Germany funding and supporting Croatia and the world focused on Bosnia &
Herzegovina; Serbia became isolated and reached out to the Soviet Union
and its neighbors in Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary for assistance. They
complied.

Timing is important. In Feb 1994, Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia are
still firmly in Serbian hands. Bosnia is in the midst of a civil war and
Serbia is firmly in the pro re-unification camp; supporting Bosnian
Serbs and Serbo-Croats against the Bosniaks, Croats and indirectly
against western elements trying to resolve the issue. Western influence
in the three Serbian provinces - Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia, is
being actively countered with both funds and force.

Serbian alignment with the Warsaw Pact has significantly tied western
and NATO hands in this region. ***OPERATION DENY FLIGHT*** is starting
to pick up steam and there is an agreement to provide air support to
UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) but the first air support mission
historically did not happen until 10 April, 94. Also ***OPERATION
MARITIME GUARD*** was integrated into EU activities forming ***OPERATION
SHARP GUARD*** in June 1993. The maritime task is largely one of
contraband interdiction, primarily smuggling by criminal elements into
and out of Italy. UNPROFOR is smaller than it historically was with less
combat power as much of that punch was provided by Russia, Poland, and
The Czech Republic, none of whom are participating. Serbia’s new Warsaw
Pact allies are making sure that Serbia is well equipped, and through
them the Bosnian Serbs and other supporting factions. So the net effect
of NATO operations to stop the smuggling is to support Serbia by denying
its opponents the funds and weapons it needs to continue the Bosnian
war, while a free flow of arms and equipment is funneled into Serbia.

At the outbreak of Northern Fury, a very interesting and delicate – from
a NATO perspective – situation exists in the Balkans, remembering that
Austria is ‘non-aligned’ and ostensibly neutral. Serbia and Croatia are
also non-aligned and unlikely to commit to war quickly as they have no
meaningful combat force. Bosnia is protected by a No-Fly zone, policed
by ***OPERATION DENY FLIGHT.*** Forces committed to UNPROFOR, and the
two NATO operations cannot engage in combat activities without violating
a UN Security Council resolution, nor can they use bases or airspace in
neutral countries to operate from without violating international law.
This will all get sorted out but it will take hours, if not a couple
days before western governments even get around to acting in this
undeniably secondary front. If Serbia were to declare itself neutral,
even for a few days, it would complicate the situation even further.
