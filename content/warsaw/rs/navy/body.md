**Navy of Serbia and Montenegro**

The Navy of Serbia and Montenegro was largely made up of ships that
escaped the naval base at Split Croatia during the Croatian civil war in
1991. These ships joined a few ships which were already based at Kotor
Montenegro to reform the fleet. Several ships were damaged and captured
by Croatia in the fighting while two submarines were evacuated on the
surface because they were undergoing repairs and refit, because Kotor
lacks the proper facilities, these two submarines are destined to be
scrapped.

NATO operations under the auspices of ***OPERATION MARITIME GUARD***
followed by ***OPERATION SHARP GUARD*** have severely curtailed
operations but local coastal patrols continue.

**Frigates**

**[Koni Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koni-class_frigate)** two
key ships to escape Croatia were the Koni class Frigates ***VPBR-31
Beograd*** and ***VPBR-32 Podgorica*** formerly ***RF-31 Split*** and
***RF-32 Koper***. Neither very large nor very modern, this ship still
causes NATO and Italy in particular grave concern as they are the most
potent threat ships permanently based in the Mediterranean. The 4K33
"Osa-M" Surface to Air Missile (SAM) launcher ( SA-N-4 Gecko), has 20
reloads giving the ship a moderate missile umbrella out to about 13Km.
The ASW suite is decent and she carries 2x 76mm guns as well as 2x 30mm
cannons acting as a last ditch Close in Weapons System (CIWS).

**[Kotor
Class](http://www.balkanwarhistory.com/2016/05/kotor-class-frigate.html)**
These two ships were designed and built in Yugoslavia and were based on
the Koni class with some improvements and repositioning of the Anti-Ship
missiles. They displace about 25% less than the Koni class and are 9
meters shorter.

**Missile Boats**

**[Končar
Class](http://www.balkanwarhistory.com/2017/04/koncar-class-missile-boat.html)**
These ships were completely designed and built in Yugoslavia as an
eventual replacement for the Osa class. Firing an improved missile, the
P-15 (S-N-2C) Styx SSM, the main improvement was to make these roughly
equivalent to the Soviet Osa II boats and more capable than the Osa I
purchased in the 1960s. They are also ten years newer than the Osa’s and
helped to establish a modern shipbuilding industry in Yugoslavia. One
ship was captured by the Croatians (RTOP-402, Vlado Ćetković) and put to
use as the
***Šibenik.***

**[Osa
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_205.htm)** The
Yugoslavian Navy took delivery of ten Osa I boats, all of which were
supposed to retire in the mid 1990s. Two of these boats were captured by
the Croatians, one was put into commission while the other was sunk as a
target
ship.

**Torpedo Boats**

[**Shershen
Class**](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_206.htm):
Four of these boats were purchased from the Soviet Union while the other
10 were built under licence in Yugoslavia. All were obsolete by 1994 and
historically were in various levels of readiness. Croatia captured two,
but one was so damaged that it was not put into service and sunk as a
target
instead.

This is a small (140 Ton) class of patrol boat designed and built in
Yugoslavia. Armed with a 40mm and quad 20mm cannon, these boats are fast
and maneuverable. Croatia captured and is using three of the 11 boats
built.

**Submarines**

**[Heroj
Class](http://www.balkanwarhistory.com/2017/10/heroj-class-submarine.html)**
These three boats were designed and built in Yugoslavia in the 1960s,
all relocated to Montenegro but ***P-821 Heroj*** was undergoing refit
at the time and remains unserviceable.

| --------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- |

**[Sava Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sava-class_submarine)**
These two boats were developed after the Heroj class and represent an
improvement on the design with more armaments, two additional torpedo
tubes and better minelaying equipment. Both escaped to Montenegro at the
outbreak of the Croatian civil war but ***P-832 Drava*** was undergoing
a major refit which was never completed.
