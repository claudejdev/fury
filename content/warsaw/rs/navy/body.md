**Navy of Serbia and Montenegro**

The Navy of Serbia and Montenegro was largely made up of ships that
escaped naval base in Croatia during the Croatian civil war in 1991.
These ships joined a few ships which were already based at Kotor
Montenegro to reform the fleet. Several ships were damaged and captured
by Croatia in the fighting while two submarines evacuated on the surface
because they were undergoing repairs and refit, because Kotor lacks the
proper facilities, these two submarines are destined to be scrapped.

NATO operations under the auspices of ***OPERATION MARITIME GUARD***
followed by ***OPERATION SHARP GUARD*** have severely curtailed
operations but local coastal patrols continue.

**Frigates**

**[Koni Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koni-class_frigate)** two
key to escape Croatia were the Koni class Frigates ***VPBR-31 Beograd
and VPBR-32 Podgorica*** formerly ***RF-31 Split*** and ***RF-32
Koper***. Neither very large nor very modern, this ship cause NATO and
Italy in particular grave concern as they are the most powerful threat
ships based in the Mediterranean. The 4K33 "Osa-M" Surface to Air
Missile (SAM) launcher, NATO designation SA-N-4 Gecko, has 20 reloads
giving the ship a moderate missile umbrella out to about 13Km. The ASW
suite is decent and she carries 2x 76mm guns as well as 2x 30mm cannons
acting as a last ditch Close in Weapons System (CIWS).

**[Kotor
Class](http://www.balkanwarhistory.com/2016/05/kotor-class-frigate.html)**
These two ships were designed and built in Yugoslavia and were based on
the Koni class with some improvements and repositioning of the Anti-Ship
missiles. These ships displace about 25% less than the Koni class and
are 9 meters shorter.

**Missile Boats**

**[Končar
Class](http://www.balkanwarhistory.com/2017/04/koncar-class-missile-boat.html)**
These ships were completely designed and built in Yugoslavia as an
eventual replacement for the Osa class. Firing an improved missile, the
P-15 (S-N-2C) Styx SSM, the main improvement was to make these
equivalent to the Soviet Osa II boats and more capable than the Osa I
purchased in the ‘60s, they were also ten years newer than the Osa’s and
helped to establish a modern shipbuilding industry in Yugoslavia. One
ship was captured by the Croatians (RTOP-402, Vlado Ćetković) and put to
use as the
***Šibenik.***

**[Osa
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_205.htm)** The
Yugoslavian Navy took delivery of ten Osa I boats, all of which were
supposed to retire in the mid ‘90s. Two of these boats were captured by
the Croatians, one was put into commission while the other was sunk as a
target
ship.

**Torpedo Boats**

**[Shershen
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_206.htm)** 4 of
these boats were purchased from the Soviet Union while the other 10 were
built under licence in Yugoslavia. All were obsolete by 1994, and
historically were in various levels of readiness. Croatia captured 2 of
the boats but one was so damaged that it was not put into service but
sunk as a target
instead.

**[Heroj
Class](http://www.balkanwarhistory.com/2017/10/heroj-class-submarine.html)**
These three boats are designed and built in Yugoslavia in the 1960s, all
relocated to Montenegro but ***P-821 Heroj*** was undergoing refit at
the time and remains unserviceable.

![](/assets/images/warsaw/cs/navy/image8.jpg)**[Sava
Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sava-class_submarine)** These 2
boats were developed after the Heroj class and represent an improvement
on the design with more armaments, two additional torpedo tubes and
better minelaying equipment. Both escaped to Montenegro at the outbreak
of the Croatian civil war but ***P-832 Drava*** was undergoing a major
refit which was never completed.
