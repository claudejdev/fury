**Bulgarian Military Sea Fleet**

The Bulgarian navy, or Military Sea Fleet, is relatively small with
limited capabilities, its main role is to support the Soviet Black Sea
Fleet in times of crisis. As the smallest element of the Bulgarian
military, the fleet was usually the last to receive funding, new
equipment or government interest.

Based in two locations; Varna, and Atia, the fleet consists mostly of
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) vessels and minesweepers, as well as a
limited number of amphibious and support ships. The major units are four
frigates, three of them and the four submarines are all obsolete. The
Bulgarian Navy is meant to operate in the Black Sea only and is
materially unable to venture beyond that effectively.

**Frigates**

**[Koni Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koni-class_frigate) *BGS
Smeli (F-11)***, formerly the Soviet ***SKR-825 Delfin***, was
transferred to the Bulgarian Navy in 1989 when the Soviets felt that the
old Riga class should retire. Not very large or modern, this ship still
represents a significant improvement in capability for Bulgaria. The
4K33 "Osa-M" Surface to Air Missile (SAM) launcher (NATO designation
SA-N-4 Gecko) has 20 reloads giving the ship a moderate missile umbrella
out to about 13Km. The ASW suite is decent and the ship carries 2x 76mm
guns as well as 2x 30mm cannons which act as a last ditch Close in
Weapons System (CIWS).

**[Riga Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warships/project_50.htm)**
Two of the three ships of this class are laid up in preservation by the
start of Northern Fury. The third, ***BGS Bodri (F-13)***, was
modernized and was still in commission, although historically it to was
supposed to retire in late 1993. The Bodri, has four SAM launchers for
the 9K32 Strela-2 missile, (NATO designation SA-7 Grail) a Man Portable
Air Defence System (MANPADS) with 16 missiles, and 2 CIWS 30mm cannons.
The main weapon systems are the 3x100mm guns and some very dated ASW
equipment. All three are located at Varna and it’s possible that at
least one other has been modernized. Should the two older ships be
activated it will take between six weeks and three months of work and
one would need a new pennant number while the other would need a new
name.

|-------|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| Riga  | F-11    | Derzki | Laid up |            |

**Missile Boats**

**[Tarantul
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_12411.htm)**
The Bulgarian Navy received one of this class in 1992 from the Soviet
Back Sea Fleet. With 4x P-15M (S-N-2C) Styx, Surface to Surface Missiles
(SSM) and high speed (42 Knts), this is a potent little ship, weighing
in at 495 tons. The ***BGS Malniya (P-101)*** is based at Atia.

**[Osa
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_205.htm)** The
Bulgarian Navy took delivery of three Osa I and three Osa II boats in
1985, although RKA-10 Uragan arrived in 1981 as a training ship under
Soviet control. The main improvement between the two sub classes is a
modernized version of the P-15 (S-N-2C) Styx SSM. All are based at Atia.

| Class  | Pennant | Name        | Status | Remarks  |

**ASW Corvettes**

**[Poti Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warships/project_204.htm)**
These rugged little ships arrived in Bulgaria during the early 1980s,
they are kept quite busy providing excellent service and have a good ASW
suite in a small package. The Bulgarian Navy operated six of these
ships.

| Class | Pennant | Name        | Status | Remarks |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------|---------|
|       | PLK-41  | Letjashhi   | Active | Atia    |

**[Pauk
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warships/project_12412.htm)** These
two ships, based on the Tarantul class hull were transferred from the
Soviet Black Sea Fleet in 1989 and 1992. They are more modern with
improved weapons and sensors but do the same job as the Poti class.

| Class | Pennant | Name        | Status | Remarks |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------|---------|
|       | PLK-13  | Reshitelni  | Active | Varna   |

**Torpedo Boats**

**[Shershen
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_206.htm)** By
1994 these six boats were obsolete and historically were in various
levels of readiness. In Northern Fury they are all in reserve status and
will require a week or so to put to sea.

| Class    | Pennant | Name      | Status  | Remarks |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Shershen | TKA-24  | Orel      | Reserve |         |

**Amphibious Ships**

**[Polnocny
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warships/project_770.htm)** The two
ships of this class form the mainstay of the ‘Landing Ship’ Division.
Each is able to lift a reinforced company sized unit of 10-12 armored
vehicles or four tanks. All landing ships are based at Atia.

| Class | Pennant | Name    | Status | Remarks |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|---------|
|       | L-701   | Sirius  | Active |         |

**[Vydra
Class](http://weaponsystems.net/weaponsystem/GG08+-+Vydra+class.html)**
These are small, rugged landing craft able to lift three tanks or four
other armored vehicles and about 100 troops. Of the 24 originally in
service, 4 have been converted to minelayers and one to a general stores
ship. The 19 remaining operate with the two Polocny class to form the
Landing Ship Division.

**Minesweepers**: Some 24 -30 minesweeping craft are in operation, based
in both ports in roughly equal numbers.

**Submarines**

**[Pobeda (Romeo)
Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo-class_submarine)** These four
boats are well past their prime, two have been decommissioned and will
probably never sail again, the other two are limited in both dive depth
and range from port.

| Class | Pennant | Name       | Status         | Remarks |
