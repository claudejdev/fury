**Bulgarian Military Sea Fleet**

The Bulgarian navy, or Military Sea Fleet, was relatively small with
limited capabilities. As the smallest element of the Bulgarian military
the fleet was usually the last to receive funding, new equipment or
government interest. The main role of the navy was to support the Soviet
Black Sea Fleet in times of crisis.

The fleet is based in two locations; Varna, and Atia and consists mostly
of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and minesweepers. In addition to as a
limited number of amphibious and support ships, there are four frigates,
three of them and the four submarines are all obsolete. The Bulgarian
Navy is meant to operate in the Black Sea only and is materially unable
to effectively venture beyond that.

**Frigates**

**[Koni Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koni-class_frigate) *BGS
Smeli (F-11)***, formerly ***SKR-825 Delfin*** in the Soviet Black Sea
Fleet, was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy in 1989 when the old Riga
class were stating to retire. Not very large or very modern, this ship
represents a significant improvement in capability. The 4K33 "Osa-M"
Surface to Air Missile (SAM) launcher, NATO designation SA-N-4 Gecko,
has 20 reloads giving the ship a moderate missile umbrella out to about
13Km. The ASW suite is decent and she carries 2x 76mm guns as well as 2x
30mm cannons acting as a last ditch Close in Weapons System (CIWS).

**[Riga Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warships/project_50.htm)**
Two of the three ships of this class in the Bulgarian Navy are laid up
in preservation by the stat of Northern Fury. The third, ***BGS Bodri
(F-13)***, was modernized and was still in commission, although
historically this ship was supposed to retire in late 1993. The Bodri,
has four SAM launchers for the 9K32 Strela-2 missile, NATO designation
SA-7 Grail, a Man Portable Air Defence System (MANPADS) with 16
missiles, and 2 CIWS 30mm cannons. The main weapon systems are the
3x100mm guns and some very dated ASW equipment. All are located at Varna
and it is possible that at least one other has been
modernized.

**Missile Boats**

**[Tarantul
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_12411.htm)**
The Bulgarian Navy received one of this class in 1992 from the Soviet
Back Sea Fleet. With 4x P-15M (S-N-2C) Styx, Surface to Surface Missiles
(SSM) and high speed (42 Knts), this is a potent little ship, weighing
in at 495 tons. The ***BGS Malniya (P-101)*** is based at Atia.

**[Osa
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_205.htm)** The
Bulgarian Navy took delivery of three Osa I and three Osa II boats. The
main improvement between the two sub classes was an improved version of
the P-15 (S-N-2C) Styx SSM. All were based at Atia.

| Class  | Pennant | Name        | Status | Remarks      |

**ASW Corvettes**

**[Poti Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warships/project_204.htm)**
These rugged little ships provided excellent service and had a good ASW
suite in a small package. The Bulgarian Navy operated six of these
ships.

| Class | Pennant | Name        | Status | Remarks        |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- | ------ | -------------- |

**[Pauk
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warships/project_12412.htm)** These
two ships, based on the Tarantul class hull were transferred from the
Soviet Black Sea Fleet in ’89 and ’92. They are more modern with
improved weapons and sensors but do the same job ast the Poti class.

| Class | Pennant | Name       | Status | Remarks        |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- | ------ | -------------- |
|       | PLK-13  | Reshitelni | Active | Based at Varna |

**Torpedo Boats**

**[Shershen
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warfareboats/project_206.htm)**
These six boats were obsolete by 1994, and historically were in various
levels of readiness. In Northern Fury they are all in reserve status and
will require a week or so to put them to sea.

| Class    | Pennant | Name     | Status  | Remarks |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Shershen | TKA-24  | Orel     | Reserve |         |

**Amphibious Ships**

**[Polnocny
Class](http://russianships.info/eng/warships/project_770.htm)** The two
ships of this class formed the mainstay of the Bulgarian ‘Landing Ship’
Division. Each is able to lift a reinforced company sized unit of 10-12
armored vehicles or four tanks. All landing ships are based at Atia.

| Class | Pennant | Name    | Status | Remarks |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
|       | L-701   | Sirius  | Active |         |
|       | L-702   | Antares | Active |         |

**[Vydra
Class](http://weaponsystems.net/weaponsystem/GG08+-+Vydra+class.html)**
These are small, rugged landing craft able to lift three tanks or four
other armored vehicles and about 100 troops. Of the 24 originally in
service, 4 have been converted to minelayers and one to a general stores
ship. The 19 remaining operate with the two Polocny class to form the
Landing Ship Division.

**Minesweepers**: Some 24 -30 minesweeping craft were in operation,
operating from both ports in roughly equal numbers.

**Submarines**

**[Pobeda (Romeo)
Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo-class_submarine)** These four
boats are well past their prime, two have been decommissioned and will
probably never sail again, the other two are limited in depth and range
from
port.
