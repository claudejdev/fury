**Bulgaria** is one of the five remaining countries forming the Warsaw
Pact but largely stays because of a fear that instability in the former
Yugoslavia will spill over its borders. The Soviets have provided some
military and economic assistance which influences some elements in
Bulgaria, but once the staunchest ally, now of any member, its loyalty
to the Soviets is the weakest.

The Bulgarian Peopleâ€™s Army (BKA) forms the bulk of the defence forces
with a small coastal navy designed to assist the Soviet Black Sea Fleet
in securing the approaches to the Bosporus, and a moderately sized air
force of about 300 combat aircraft.
