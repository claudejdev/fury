**Bulgarian Air and Air Defence Forces**

The Bulgarian Air Force operates about 330 front line combat aircraft,
85 helicopters, 20 transport and over 100 training aircraft as well as
about 85 air defence missile systems. Although the equipment is mostly
dated by 1994, maintenance and training standards are high. The primary
focus of the air force is to look south towards Greece and Turkey, where
friction at the border is common. Although there are no Soviet air
elements hosted on Bulgarian bases, plans are in place for immediate
reinforcement in the event of war.

Organized into two Air Defence Divisions and one Composite Aviation
Corps, the force has two distinct and separate roles: The two Air
Defence formations concentrating on Air Superiority while the deployable
Aviation Corps is specifically tasked to support the Army.

***(Note that some consolidation of various types has occurred in the
Northern Fury world, primarily this eases scenario construction and
clutter with little material difference. Although numbers vary by
source, given the political situation I tend to err on the side of
enhancement.)***

**MiG-21**

Although these are dated and primarily used in the ground support role,
one squadron remains in the air defence structure. The plan is to
replace these aging aircraft with MiG-29 for air defence and MiG-27 for
ground support, but that will not happen before war breaks out in 1994.
The oldest of the MiG-21’s remaining in service are the Air Defence
**MiG-21PFM** ‘Fishbed F’, these are improved 1<sup>st</sup> generation
interceptors with a belly mounted gun pod and obsolete missiles. Only
one Sqn remains but there are many in reserve.

There are two versions of 2<sup>nd</sup> generation MiG-21s in service.
Bulgaria only operated six **MiG-21RF** Fishbed-H, this reconnaissance
variant is sometimes considered the ultimate 1<sup>st</sup> generation
Fishbed, but it had the typical ‘Fat’ spine of later aircraft. More
common was the **MiG-21MF** Fishbed-J, a ground attack version which
could carry a wide selection of munitions, this aircraft had an improved
radar and a more powerful engine with a flush mounted gun. ***(Note that
the 48 ‘MF’ represented here include 15 ‘M’ and 20 ‘MF’ variants plus 15
‘MF’ transferred from the former East German air force.)***

The final production aircraft, the Fishbed-L was often called
3<sup>rd</sup> generation, these were the **MiG-21bis** or ‘plus’. This
version had a much more powerful engine, redesigned airframe and
improved avionics resulting in a lighter, stronger and more agile
fighter with a look down radar and wider selection of munitions.

Additionally about 30 two seat training variants operated in an air
combat training squadron, the **MiG-21UM** Mongol-B, with equivalent
avionics to the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation MiG-21bis. All fighter pilots
spent time on this type to learn the basics of air
combat.

**MiG-23**

![](/assets/images/warsaw/bg/air/image3.png)

Similarly, there is a variety of MiG-23 Floggers employed in the
Bulgarian air force. The variable wing geometry allowed for a very
flexible airframe and this ubiquitous aircraft was a workhorse
throughout the Warsaw Pact. Although there are a few 1<sup>st</sup>
generation **MiG-23MF** (probably seven) in the inventory, for Northern
fury these have been rolled into a collective group with the two
‘**ML**’ and nine ‘**MLA**’ variants. Therefore, one squadron of 18x
**MiG-23MLA** aircraft is represented. These Flogger-G aircraft are
2<sup>nd</sup> generation, with very capable radars, electronic
countermeasures and weapons loads.

Historically, there were also 20 of the much-improved type, the
**MiG-23MLD** Flogger-K, this was the ultimate air to air Flogger
available anywhere. Bulgaria had a plan to upgrade all its earlier model
interceptors either to the Flogger-K or ideally MiG-29s, but that has
not happened yet. In Northern Fury an additional four **‘MLD’**
airframes were obtained from the former East Germany to bring one
squadron up to full strength of 24.

The other major derivative in use was the ground attack **MiG-23BN**
Flogger-H. Although envisioned as an interim adaptation for this role,
these aircraft proved quite effective and popular, but fell short of the
capabilities shown by the later MiG-27. Bulgaria wanted the MiG-27 and
was pushing Moscow for priority but was unable to pry them away from the
Soviets, so in consolation they were able to obtain 40 of the Flogger-H.

Additionally, Bulgaria operated 15 **MiG-23UB** Flogger-C training
aircraft. About half were maintained at the Combat Training school while
the rest were sprinkled around the squadrons to allow pilots to maintain
qualifications. These were not used in
combat.

**MiG-29**

By far the most modern and capable aircraft in the Bulgarian inventory
is the **MiG-29A**. A true multi-roll 4<sup>th</sup> generation aircraft
able to match NATO air superiority fighters on a nearly equal bases,
this aircraft was very advanced, highly maneuverable, and quite rugged.
Historically Bulgaria received 12 **Fulcrum A** plus 4 two seat ‘**UB**’
trainers by 1994, while in Northern Fury the schedule for an additional
six has been advanced and they are available. The primary task is to
counter Turkish and Greek F-16s and they are deployed almost exclusively
in the Air Defense
role.

**Su-22**

A dedicated ground attack aircraft, the variable geometry **Su-22M-4K**
Fitter arrived in the late 1980s to replace some vary obsolete aircraft
types. These aircraft specializes in low level, high speed deep strike
and interdiction missions and were a major enhancement for the
Bulgarians. As the ultimate evolution of this type, the ‘**4K’** was
capable of delivering a decent bomb load, was easy to maintain, and
could sustain tremendous abuse and survive. The 18 aircraft in service
were employed in the strike/reconnaissance role, having the ability to
conduct high speed low altitude reconnaissance as well as bombing tasks.
Additionally, four **Su-22UM-3K** two seat trainers were used by the
Squadron.

**Su-25**

While the Fitters concentrated on deep strike missions, another
dedicated ground attack aircraft, the **Su-25 Frogfoot** specialized in
close support of ground forces. Readily identifiable as the Soviet
answer to the American A-10 Warthog, the Frogfoot is an agile, rugged
and extremely capable bomber. Historically Bulgaria operated 32
**Su-25K** plus four **Su-25UBK** training variants, but in Northern
Fury they have received an additional four bringing the total to 36
front line aircraft with the training versions held at the Regimental
level.
