**Bulgarian Air and Air Defence Forces**

The Bulgarian Air Force operates about 330 front line combat aircraft,
85 helicopters, 20 transport and over 100 training aircraft as well as
about 85 air defence missile systems. Although mostly quite dated by
1994, maintenance and training standards are high. The primary focus of
the air force is to look south towards Greece and Turkey, although there
are no Soviet air elements hosted on Bulgarian bases, there are plans
for immediate reinforcement in the event of war.

Organized into two Air Defence Divisions and one Composite Aviation
Corps, the force has two distinct and separate roles with Air Defence
forces concentrating on Air Superiority while the deployable Aviation
Corps supports the Army.

***(Note that some consolidation of various types has occurred in the
Northern Fury world, primarily this eases scenario construction and
clutter with little material difference. Although numbers vary by
source, I tend to err on the side of improvement given the political
situation.)***

**MiG-21**

![](/assets/images/warsaw/bg/air/image1.jpg)Although these are
quite dated and primarily used in the ground support role, one squadron
remains in the air defence structure. The plan is to replace these with
MiG-29 for air defence and MiG-27 for ground support but that will not
happen before war breaks out in 1994. The oldest of the MiG-21’s
remaining in service are the Air Defence **MiG-21PFM** ‘Fishbed F’.
These are improved 1<sup>st</sup> generation interceptors with a belly
mounted gun pod and obsolete missiles. Only one Sqn of these remain but
there are many in reserve.

There are two versions of 2<sup>nd</sup> generation MiG-21s in service,
the **MiG-21RF** Fishbed-H, or reconnaissance variant is sometimes
considered the ultimate 1<sup>st</sup> generation but it had the typical
‘Fat’ spine of the later aircraft. Bulgaria only operated 6 MiG-21RFs.
The **MiG-21MF** Fishbed-J was a ground attack version which could carry
a much wider selection of munitions, had improved radar and more
powerful engine and a flush mounted gun. ***(Note that the 48
represented here include 15 ‘M’ and 20 ‘MF’ variants plus 15 ‘MFs’
transferred from the former East German air force.)***

The final production, sometimes called 3<sup>rd</sup> generation, were
the **MiG-21bis** or ‘plus’ Fishbed-L, with a much more powerful engine,
redesigned airframe and avionics resulting in a lighter, stronger and
more agile aircraft with a look down radar and wider selection of
munitions.

Additionally about 30 two seat training variants operated in an air
combat training squadron, the **MiG-21UM** Mongol-B, with equivalent
avionics to the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation MiG-21bis. All fighter pilots
spent time on this type to learn the basics of air
combat.

**MiG-23**

![](/assets/images/warsaw/bg/air/image3.png)Similarly there is a
variety of MiG-23 Floggers employed in the Bulgarian air force. The
variable wing geometry allowed for a very flexible airframe and this
ubiquitous aircraft was a workhorse throughout the Warsaw Pact. Although
there are a few 1<sup>st</sup> generation MiG-23MF in the inventory
these have been rolled into a collective group for Northern fury. I
believe that Bulgaria possessed 7x MiG-23MF in 1989, along with 2x ‘ML’
and 9x ‘MLA’ variants – all of these have been consolidated into one
squadron of 18x **MiG-23MLA**. These Flogger-G aircraft are
2<sup>nd</sup> generation, with very capable radars, electronic
countermeasures and weapons loads.

An improved version was incorporated in the form of the **MiG-23MLD**
Flogger-K, the ultimate air to air Flogger available. Bulgaria desires
to upgrade all of its earlier model interceptors either to this or
ideally MiG-29s, but this has not happened yet, although an additional
few were obtained from the former East Germany to bring the one squadron
up to strength.

The other major derivative in use was the ground attack version. **The
MiG-23BN** Flogger-H, an interim adaptation which proved quite effective
and popular, it fell short of the capabilities shown by the MiG-27.
Bulgaria wanted the MiG-27 but was only able to obtain 40 of the
Flogger-H.

Additionally, Bulgaria operated 15 **MiG-23UB** Flogger-C training
aircraft. About half were maintained at the Combat Training school while
the rest were sprinkled around the squadrons to allow pilots to maintain
qualifications. These were not used in
combat.

**MiG-29**

By far the most modern and capable aircraft in the Bulgarian inventory
is the **MiG-29A**. A true multi-roll 4<sup>th</sup> generation aircraft
able to match NATO air superiority fighters on a near one to one bases,
the Fulcrum was very advanced, highly maneuverable, and quite rugged.
Historically Bulgaria received 12 Fulcrum A plus 4 two seat ‘UB’
trainers, while in Northern Fury and additional 6 have been provided.
The primary task is to counter Turkish and Greek F-16s and they are
deployed almost exclusively in the Air Defense
role.

**Su-22**

A dedicated ground attack aircraft, the variable geometry Su-22 Fitter
was a relatively modern addition to the Bulgarian inventory, only
arriving in the mid ‘80s to replace some aging types. This type
specialized in low level, high speed deep strike missions. The primary
version used is the **Su-22M-4K** which is the ultimate version of this
type, capable of delivering a decent bomb load, easy to maintain, and
able to sustain tremendous abuse and survive. The 18 aircraft in service
were employed in the strike/reconnaissance role, having the ability to
conduct high speed low altitude reconnaissance as well as bombing tasks.
Additionally, 4 **Su-22UM-3K** two seat trainers were used by the
Squadron.

**Su-25**

Another dedicated ground attack aircraft, this one specializing in close
air support is the Su-25 Frogfoot. This highly identifiable airframe is
the Soviet answer to the American A-10 Warthog, and it is a very agile,
rugged and capable bomber. Historically Bulgaria operated 32 **Su-25K**
plus 4 **Su-25UBK** training variants, but in Northern Fury they have
received an additional 4 bringing the total to 36 line aircraft with the
training versions held at the Regimental
level.
