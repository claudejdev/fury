**Hungarian People’s Army (HPA)**

The HPA remained in its pre-1989 structure and stuck with Soviet style
organizations, the planned (and historically carried out) restructuring
from a Motor Rifle Division (MRD) based configuration to a Brigade
organization was meant to save command overhead and streamline the army,
but never completed. The halt to the changes was due primarily to Soviet
assurances that several MRDs would be placed under Hungarian command so
the old structure, meant for rapid mobilization and expansion was
maintained.

Along with the change in plans came a change in orientation for the HPA.
Instead of reinforcing a push into southern Germany after transiting
Czechoslovakia – the army was now looking to the west and southward
towards the new states of the former Yugoslavia. With NATO forces
essentially on the border, and with increasing civil unrest in Hungary
itself, there was now a clear threat and no buffer state. Therefore
5<sup>th</sup> Hungarian Combined Arms Army (CAA) was tasked to look at
both offensive and defensive operations oriented towards Zagreb or
Ljubljana, with a view to forcing NATO forces to a standstill closer to
Italy than Hungary.

Organized largely along Soviet lines, much of the equipment such as the
D-442 FUG-APC was designed and built domestically and exported to Poland
as the FUG and Czechoslovakia as the OT-65 and the former East Germany
as PSzH-IV, or the FUG-65 reconnaissance vehicle
