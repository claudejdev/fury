**Hungarian Air and Air Defence Forces**

The Hungarian Air Force operates about 220 front line combat aircraft,
about 120 helicopters, 15 transport and about 30 training aircraft as
well as air defence missile systems. Although mostly dated by 1994, an
infusion of new and replacement aircraft from the Soviet Union had
increased force readiness. The primary focus of the air force is to
support the Army, relying on Soviet air forces based in Hungary to
maintain air superiority. There are about 200 front line Soviet aircraft
based in Hungary including 120 MiG-29 and 40 Su-27.

provides a useful history of MiG aircraft in the Hungarian inventory.

**MiG-21**

![](/assets/images/warsaw/hu/airforce/image1.jpg)Three generations
of the ubiquitous MiG-21 are currently present in the Hungarian air
force. The oldest remaining in service are the **MiG-21PF** ‘Fishbed F’.
These are called 2<sup>nd</sup> generation but are only slightly
improved 1<sup>st</sup> generation interceptors with a belly mounted gun
pod and obsolete missiles. Only one Sqn of these are in service but they
should be retired.

The next generation MiG-21s in service, the 12x **MiG-21RF** Fishbed-H,
or reconnaissance variant and the 45x **MiG-21MF** Fishbed-J ground
attack version are also on the books for retirement. It is likely that
plans are in place to have the Mig-29s assume the ground attack role
while the Su-22 will take over the reconnaissance role; however this has
not yet happened.

Destined to stay in the lineup for some time is the final production,
sometimes called 3<sup>rd</sup> generation, **MiG-21bis** or ‘plus’
Fishbed-L. This aircraft has a much more powerful engine, redesigned
airframe and avionics resulting in a lighter, stronger and more agile
aircraft with a look down radar and wider selection of munitions.

Additionally about 40 two seat training variants operated in an air
combat training squadron, the **MiG-21UM** Mongol-B, with equivalent
avionics to the 3<sup>rd</sup> generation MiG-21bis. All fighter pilots
spend time on this type to learn the basics of air
combat.

Hungary only operates 12x **MiG-23**MF Flogger-Bs. The variable wing
geometry allowed for a very flexible airframe and until the acquisition
of the MiG-29, this was the only capable air to air platform which could
hold its own against NATO 3<sup>rd</sup> generation aircraft. It is
decisively outclassed by the newer 4<sup>th</sup> generation aircraft so
they now work in the ground attack role with the MiG-21bis of
47<sup>th</sup> Regt. There are also 2x **MiG-23UB** Flogger-C training
aircraft.

**MiG-29**

By far the most modern and capable aircraft in the Bulgarian inventory
is the **MiG-29A**. A true multi-roll 4<sup>th</sup> generation aircraft
able to match NATO air superiority fighters on a near one to one bases,
the Fulcrum was very advanced, highly maneuverable, and quite rugged.
Historically Hungary received 22 Fulcrum A plus 6 two seat ‘UB’
trainers, while in Northern Fury and additional 2 have been provided
with at least another 18 planned but not yet delivered. The primary task
is to introduce modern ground attack capability into the Hungarian air
force but they are also able to stand up against American F-16s and
Italian Tornados working out of northern
Italy.

**Su-22**

![](/assets/images/warsaw/hu/airforce/image4.jpeg)A dedicated
ground attack aircraft, the variable geometry Su-22 Fitter employed in
the Hungarian air force was the slightly outdated **Su-22M-3K**,
arriving in the early ‘80s. The 15 aircraft in service were employed in
the strike/reconnaissance role, having the ability to conduct high speed
low altitude reconnaissance as well as bombing tasks. They were capable
of delivering a decent bomb load, easy to maintain, and able to sustain
tremendous abuse and survive.

**Su-25**

Specializing in close air support is the Su-25 Frogfoot. This highly
identifiable airframe is the Soviet answer to the American A-10 Warthog,
and it is a very agile, rugged and capable bomber. Historically
Hungary’s order for 40 **Su-25K** plus 4 **Su-25UBK** training
variants was canceled in the early ‘90s but in Northern Fury the request
was filled and they arrived by 1993.
