**Hungary** is one of the five remaining countries forming the Warsaw
Pact but is a government at odds with its people. The current regime
relies on Soviet assistance, both militarily and economically to remain
solvent. To a lesser extent than in Czechoslovakia, displaced Soviet
forces have established residence in Hungary, causing some violent
friction with many localities. Hungarian state intelligence agencies
have grown substantially and are kept quite busy maintaining visibility
on dissident groups, and individuals traveling into the Balkans. The
border with Austria is closed.

The Hungarian Peopleâ€™s Army (HPA) forms the bulk of the defence forces
with a moderately sized but dated air force of about 230 combat
aircraft. Recent arrivals of MiG-29 and Su-25s have greatly augmented
capabilities which were otherwise all but perished. The Navy is composed
of a fairly extensive riverine flotilla which will not be explored here.
