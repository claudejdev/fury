The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed on 4 April 1949, as a Military/Political body to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact (WP)countries. The basis of the alliance is the collective defence codified in Article Five of the treaty which states: "...that an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies."
