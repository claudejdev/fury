Italy is an original member of NATO as one of the 12 nations forming the
alliance in 1949. Italy and NATO however had a complicated relationship;
between 1946 and 1994 the government changed 61 times. Most of the
turmoil however was internal to Italy and in that time only eight
different presidents sat, they were mostly Right Wing. Internally
however the tumultuous domestic political situation meant a decade of
political tension where violent riots and bombings were an ever-present
threat and strong Socialist and Communist parties.

The Italian military is relatively large, conscript based and focused
entirely on NATOs Allied Forces South (AFSOUTH) headquartered in Naples.
