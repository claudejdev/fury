**Italian Air Force**: The Aeronautica Militare (AM) was formed from the
Regia Aeronautica when Italy transformed from a monarchy to a republic
in 1946. The AM is a medium sized air force employing most modern
capabilities available in 1994.

[**Panavia
Tornado**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panavia_Tornado#Italian_Air_Force_\(Aeronautica_Militare\)):
The Tornado was developed jointly by Britain, Germany and Italy.
Eventually almost 1000 Tornados were produced in three main variants:
The ADV or Air Defence Variant; IDS or Interdictor/Strike variant and;
ECR, the Electronic Combat Reconnaissance version. Italy was primarily
focused on the IDS and purchased 100 examples to fulfill the strike
role. Italy converted 16 of these to ECRs but not until 1998, so they do
not figure into Northern Fury. For the Air superiority role, the AM was
counting on the much delayed Eurofighter Typhoon to replace its aging
fleet of Starfighters, but since the first production would be more than
a decade away (in 2003), a solutions was needed. Therefore 24 British
ADV aircraft were leased from the RAF and flown by the AM; historically
this deal was made in 1993 with acceptance in 1995 but in Northern Fury
these dates are advanced by two years to 1991 and 1993 respectively.
Therefore at the start of Northern Fury the AM is operating 124 Tornados
including 100 IDS and 24
ADVs.

[**F-104
Starfighter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-104_Starfighter):
Most of NATO used the Starfighter for a time but it became the backbone
of Italy’s AM for many years with the last one not retiring until 2004.
With over 360 received, by 1994 most were the Aeritalia built F-104S and
with over 100 destroyed in accidents the older variants had all but
disappeared. Used primarily as air to air interceptors the F-104S was
the ultimate version with improved radar, increased stability and much
needed safety improvements. 147 of these were subsequently modified to
the ASA (Weapons Systems Update) standard improving the radar once again
with a ‘Look-down – Shoot-down’ capability. The ASA-2, which all were
later modified to could fire ‘all-aspect’ Aim-9L Sidewinders, Aim-7
Sparrow and Aspide missiles.

[**A-11 Ghibli
(AMX)**:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMX_International_AMX) The
Italian designed ground attack aircraft was intended to replace the G.91
but those plans were never followed through. The A-11 was useful in its
limited ground attack role but could not compete internationally with
the American A-10 or Soviet Su-25. Only Italy and Brazil operated these
aircraft and Italy only acquired 35 operational aircraft and 11 two seat
training versions.

[**G.91Y**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_G.91Y): Another Italian
designed ground attack aircraft entering service in the 1970s. By 1994
the subsonic aircraft was considered two small and limited for front
line service, but not enough A-11s were procured to replace it. 65
aircraft were operated.
