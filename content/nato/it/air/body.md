**Italian Air Force**: The Aeronautica Militare (AM) was formed from the
Regia Aeronautica when Italy transformed from a monarchy to a republic
in 1946. The AM is a medium sized air force employing most modern
capabilities available in 1994.

[**Panavia
Tornado**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panavia_Tornado#Italian_Air_Force_(Aeronautica_Militare)):
The Tornado was developed jointly by Britain, Germany and Italy.
Eventually almost 1000 Tornados were produced in three main variants:
The ADV or Air Defence Variant; IDS or Interdictor/Strike variant and;
ECR, the Electronic Combat Reconnaissance version. Italy was primarily
focused on the IDS and purchased 100 examples to fulfill the strike
role. Eventually converting 16 of these to ECRs but not until 1998, so
they do not figure into Northern Fury. For the Air superiority role, the
AM was counting on the much delayed Eurofighter Typhoon to replace its
aging fleet of Starfighters, but since the first production would be
more than a decade away (in 2003), a quick solutions was needed.
Therefore 24 British ADV aircraft were leased from the RAF and flown by
the AM; historically this deal was made in 1993 with acceptance in 1995
but in Northern Fury these dates are advanced by two years to 1991 and
1993 respectively. Therefore at the start of Northern Fury the AM is
operating 124 Tornados including 100 IDS and 24 ADVs.

[**F-104
Starfighter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-104_Starfighter):
Most of NATO used the Starfighter for a time but as it’s popularity
faded in many countries, it became the backbone of Italy’s AM for many
years with the last one not retiring until 2004. With over 360 received,
by 1994 most were the Aeritalia built F-104S and with over 100 destroyed
in accidents the older variants had all but disappeared. Used primarily
as air to air interceptors the F-104S was the ultimate fighter version
with improved radar, increased stability and much needed safety
improvements. 147 were subsequently modified to the ASA (Weapons Systems
Update) standard, improving the radar once again with a ‘Look-down –
Shoot-down’ capability. The ASA-2, which all were later modified to
could fire ‘all-aspect’ Aim-9L Sidewinders, Aim-7 Sparrow and Aspide
missiles. 28\* Gruppo historically lost all of its aircraft in 1982,
which were moved to Grosseto but remained active until 1993 – in
Northern Fury this squadron was re-equipped with F-104s instead of
adopting the AMX.

[**A-11 Ghibli
(AMX)**:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMX_International_AMX) The
Italian designed ground attack aircraft was intended to replace the G.91
but those plans were never followed through. The A-11 was useful in its
limited ground attack role but could not compete internationally with
the American A-10 or Soviet Su-25. Only Italy and Brazil operated these
aircraft and Italy only acquired 35 operational aircraft and 11 two seat
training versions. Some of the single and all of the double seat AMX
were upgraded (in Northern Fury) to enable the use of PGM about two
years before they were historically.

[**G.91Y**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_G.91Y): Another Italian
designed ground attack aircraft entering service in the 1970s. By 1994
this subsonic aircraft was considered two small and limited for front
line service, but not enough A-11s were procured to replace it. In
Northern Fury, 65 aircraft remained with 48 employed in operational
squadrons.

[**BR.1150
Atlantic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bréguet_1150_Atlantic): A
French designed Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) primarily focused on
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) support to the Navy. Italy purchased 18
which by 1994 were operated by two Stormo (Air Wing) each with one
Gruppo (Squadron).

**[G.222](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeritalia_G.222):** An Italian
designed and built medium transport aircraft, the only other NATO
country to purchase the G.222 was the US who acquired ten in 1990 for
use in Panama (called the C-27A), although Venezuela, Nigeria, Somalia
UAE, Thailand, Peru, Libya and Argentina. Compared to the French C.160
Transall the G.222 has shorter range, is slower and carries about half
the load. Italy operated about 50 aircraft (not including Fire Fighting
versions), 44 of them being standard transports and two Electronic
Warfare versions (G.222VS), and four Radio/Radar calibration version
(G.222RM).
