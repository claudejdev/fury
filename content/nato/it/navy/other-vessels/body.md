**Mine Countermeasures Craft**

In addition to the new Mine Hunters listed hear, the Italian Navy has
about 30 older minesweepers of 1950’s vintage that were retired in the
past decade or indeed are still in commission but not often used.

**[Lerici
Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lerici-class_minehunter#Lerici_class):**
These four ships are classed as Mine Hunters and are equipped with
Remotely Operated Vehicles, a hyperbaric chamber and specialist divers
to actively hunt and destroy mines as opposed to the classic mine
sweepers. They routinely serve one of the three Standing NATO Mine
Countermeasures Groups (SNMCMG) but focus on SNMCMG 2 in the Adriatic
with one ship supporting the new SNMCMG 3 at Djbouti.

| Class  | Pennant | Name    | Task    | Remarks  |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Lerici | M 5550  | Lerici  | In Port |          |
|        | M 5551  | Sapri   | In Port |          |
|        | M 5552  | Malazzo | SNMCMG3 | Djbouti  |
|        | M 5553  | Vieste  | SNMCMG2 | Adriatic |

**Gaeta Class:** Larger and more modern than the Lerici class, they have
essentially the same capabilities. The final two of the eight ships are
still under construction but the fifth and sixth were launched ahead of
their historic schedule.

| Class | Pennant | Name      | Task        | Remarks  |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Gaeta | M 5554  | Gaeta     | In Port     |          |
|       | M 5555  | Termoli   | SNMCMG2     | Adriatic |
|       | M 5556  | Alghero   | In Port     |          |
|       | M 5557  | Numana    | SNMCMG2     | Adriatic |
|       | M 5558  | Crotone   | Workups     | Dec 93   |
|       | M 5559  | Viareggio | Fitting out | Jan 94   |
|       | M 5560  | Chioggia  | Building    | Mar 95   |
|       | M 5561  | Rimini    | Building    | Jun 95   |

**Italian Amphibious Ships**

Italy has replaced all of its older post World War Two amphibious ships
with three modern, state of the art LPD (Landing Platform Dock) of the
***San Giorgio*** class, complete with a new suite of Landing Craft.

**[San Giorgio
Class](http://www.military-today.com/navy/san_giorgio_class.htm):**
These three vessels can lift about a battalion of marines each, with 36
vehicles or 30 tanks. They can operate 3x Sea King helicopters and
several landing craft of varying size. The lead two ships can unload on
the beach through bow doors and a ramp while the third cannot but has
slighting more accommodation space. All three are available for the
Northern Fury campaign, the labor problems encountered with ***San
Giusto*** do not happen and she is commissioned in late 1993.

| Class       | Pennant | Name        | Task            | Remarks  |
|-------------|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| San Giorgio | L 9892  | San Giorgio | In Port         |          |
|             | L 9893  | San Marco   | In Port         |          |
|             | L 9894  | San Giusto  | Training cruise | Adriatic |

**Italian Support Ships**

Italy operates two small oilers of the ***Stromboli*** class. There are
many port tenders and support barges but they are not critical to our
purpose here.

[**Stromboli
Class**:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromboli-class_replenishment_oiler)
These two oilers are designed primarily to support Italian task groups
in the Mediterranean. They are small, about 20% of the size of the big
US AORs – but are capable of assisting combat ships to stay at sea
longer, which is their job. They carry diesel, a small amount of
aviation fuel and about 300 tons of dry goods, certainly not enough to
resupply the ***Giuseppe Garibaldi*** but adequate for an ASW Task
Group.

| Class     | Pennant | Name      | Task     | Remarks |
|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Stromboli | A 5327  | Stromboli | Adriatic |         |
|           | A 5329  | Vesuvio   | In Port  |         |
