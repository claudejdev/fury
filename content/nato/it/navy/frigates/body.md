**Italian Frigates**

Italy operates Six classes of Frigates and Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV)
comprising 30 ships. Used primarily for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW)
work and in peacetime, showing the flag around the globe. These ships
are generally modern and quite capable, only the Alpino class could be
considered nearing obsolescence and they had many systems modernized in
the 1980s, most others are less than 20 or even 10 years old. All but
the Minerva class operate ASW helicopters. Sparviero-class patrol boats
are also included in this section for convenience, they are not
Frigates.

[**Maestrale**
**Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maestrale-class_frigate): This
class of eight general purpose ASW Frigates were commissioned in the
early ‘80s and widely used by the Italian Navy on many operations. For
air defense they have the Italian designed Aspide short range surface to
air missiles (SAM) augmented by 20mm and 40mm cannon. In addition to the
127mm gun, these ships use four Italian designed Otomat Mk2 Surface to
Surface Missiles (SSM) for anti-ship targeting. ASW work is carried out
by two AB-212 Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopters backed up by
onboard torpedo and sonar.

[**Lupo/Artigliere
Class**:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupo-class_frigate) The Lupo was
a general purpose ASW frigate commissioned into the Italian Navy in the
late ‘80s, that enjoyed some commercial success, Peru acquiring four and
Venezuela purchasing another six. The Artigliere class were originally
destined for Iraq as the Soldati class but they were seized during the
Gulf war and outfitted as OPVs with all ASW equipment removed.
Historically this seizure happened in 93 with the ships commissioning in
94-96, for Northern Fury the seizure happened in 1991 and they were all
commissioned by the end of 1993. For air defense they have the Aspide
short range SAMs augmented by 40mm cannon. For anti-ship targeting there
are eight Otomat Mk2 SSM and a the 127mm gun. ASW work on the Lupo ships
is carried out by an AB-212 Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopters
backed up by onboard torpedo and sonar. The Artigliere ships have double
the number of Aspide SAMs but no sonar or onboard torpedoes, they do
have a helicopter which can carry out ASW work but it is primarily for
maritime patrolling.

[**Alpino Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpino-class_frigate):
Although these are the oldest of the ASW Frigates in the Italian Navy
they were both modernized in the 1980s with updated sonar and electronic
warfare equipment. The class introduced variable depth sonar and on
board helicopters to the Italian Navy but they are severely lacking in
air defense or anti shipping capability, having only Oto-Melara 76mm
guns.

**Minerva Class**: This is a class of coastal ASW ship that is probably
better described as a Corvette due to their small size of 1,200 tons.

Torpedoes while four of them carry eight Aspide SAMs in an Albatross
launcher and the other four carry six Otomat Mk2 SSM
