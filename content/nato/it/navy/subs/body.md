**Italian Submarines**

[**Toti Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toti-class_submarine):
These four small submarines were the first built by Italy after World
War Two. Roughly equivalent to the German Built Type 205, these are
small, maneuverable, quiet, and pack a decent punch with six torpedoes.
This class began to retire in 1991 but in Northern Fury, the two that
retired are being held in ready reserve and can put to sea in less than
30 days.

[**Sauro
Class**](https://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/detail.asp?ship_id=sauro-class-diesel-electric-attack-submarine-italy#overview):
The Sauro class was built in four batches of two boats each starting in
the 1970â€™s. They have a better dive depth than the Toti class and are
much larger, three times the displacement and \~50% larger with double
the crew. Each batch has evolutionary improvements in sensors, crew
accommodation, sound dampening and general operational capability. In
Northern Fury the batch IV boats started construction about a year
earlier than they did in real life and both are available for the
campaign, with S 525 conducting her workup
trials.
