Italy has a moderate sized navy known as the Marina Militare (MM) which had recently been modernized with some very capable ships, most of the older ships had been retired but some were still held in reserve preservation.

**Aircraft Carrier**: Italy boasts one light Aircraft Carrier; The Giuseppe Garibaldi which is relatively new but holding only a limited air group of 12-16 AV-8B Harrier II+ and 12-18 helicopters of various types. The Harriers, historically delivered between 1994 and 1998 (3 were available for deployment of the Garibaldi in Jan 95), were accelerated into service and, although new with crew under training, they are available for the start of Northern Fury.

**Guided Missile Helicopter Cruisers (CGH)**: Similar to the Soviet Moskva or French Jeanne d‘Arc, these ships were primarily focused on leading ASW Task Groups. Of the three, the two Andrea Doria class were tied up in reserve preservation but will make an appearance before the end of the Northern Fury Campaign.

**Destroyers**: Although Italy only had four Destroyers, the Audace Class was considered world class when built, now reaching mid life, this position was taken by the brand new Durand de la Penne class. All four are capable all round ships with excellent air defence, anti surface and ASW capabilities, and superb sensors. The one curiosity is the effectiveness of the AB.212 ASW helicopter.

The Lupo class which was quite successful in foreign sails with 14 of 18 being sold offshore and four being commissioned. The Lupo‘s were followed by eight Maestrale‘s, another very successful class of ship suitable for diverse duties at home and abroad. The newly commissioned Minerva class FFL or Corvette was an excellent coastal ASW platform and the Cassiopeia class OPV rounded out the fleet.
