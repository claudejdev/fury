*C-550 Vittorio Venito*

The ***Vittorio Venito*** is due to start a patrol as part of NATO’s
***Operation Maritime Guard*** off the coast of the Former Republic of
Yugoslavia (FRY). Although she doesn’t have the striking power of the
*Giuseppe Garibaldi but here helicopters will prove very useful in
interdicting any potential blockade runners.*
