interests around the world it uses these small and versatile ships.

[**La Fayette
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Fayette-class_frigate): In the
Northern Fury world the La Fayette class was started 2 years earlier
then it was historically and the name-ship of the class is on her first
deployment to the Persian Gulf when war breaks out. Called the ‘Stealth
Frigate’, she has a sleek modern shape with a reduced radar cross
section. The weapons suite is fairly standard although modernized with
New Generation (NG) Crotale Surface to Air (SAM) short range missiles
and Block II Exocet Anti-Ship Missiles (ASM), but the electronic and
sensor suite is quite extensive.

[**Floreal
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floréal-class_frigate): These
ships are small and inexpensive, built to commercial and not military
standards, they are not meant for warfighting and have only a modest
weapons suite; they are Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV) more than
Frigates. The two Exocet ASMs could not hope to succeed overcoming the
defences to sink a warship, but they are enough to fend of pirates or
commerce raiders. They can host a helicopter which is a major asset in
any situation.
