**French Submarines**

France, like Britain maintains a small fleet of submarines covering the
full gamut of capabilities. The Redoubtable class nuclear powered
Ballistic Missile submarines (SSBN) provide much of France’s strategic
deterrence, the Rubis class nuclear powered fleet boats (SSN) provide
operational flexibility while the small diesel powered Agosta class
(SSK) provide the ability to operate in shallow coastal waters.

[**Redoutable
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redoutable-class_submarine_(1967)):
These SSBN (SNLE in French) form the naval arm of the French strategic
nuclear triad. The lead boat *Redoutable* is in reserve while the five
remaining boats have been heavily upgraded (*Foudroyant* completed in
1993) to fire the much improved M4 Ballistic missile with six MIRV
(Multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) warheads of 150
Kilotons. Generally, two boats are on patrol, one is refitting and the
other two are preparing for patrol at all times. The replacement class
of SSBNs *Le Triomphant*, is under construction and the five remaining
*Redoutable* class will retire as the four new boats are commissioned
beginning in 1997.

[**Rubis Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/rubis_class.htm):
The smallest SSNs ever built, they are based on the same hull design as
the *Agosta* class SSK with a French designed reactor. Initially four
boats were built in the 1980s with four improved [*Amethyste*
Class](http://www.military-today.com/navy/amethyste_class.htm) ordered
but only two commissioned in 1992 and 1993. All four of the original
boats were upgraded with equivalent systems and hull design to the
*Amethyste* boats, the last is still undergoing that refit. In Northern
Fury, the last two *Amethyste* boats have not been canceled and are
still building. In addition to torpedoes, these boats can fire the
Exocet Anti-Ship Missile (ASM)

[***Agosta*
class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/agosta_class.htm): These
small, maneuverable and very quiet boats represent the last
conventionally powered submarines built by France. Their four torpedo
tubes are unique, they can operate quietly at any depth and speed and
have all been refitted to fire the Exocet ASM. La Praya has the capacity
to fit a removable swimmer delivery compartment, similar to the US Dry
Dock Shelter (DDS)
