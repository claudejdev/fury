NATO/France/Navy/Aircraft Carriers/CVG Jeanne d’Arc

**FS Jeanne d’Arc (R 97)**

The venerable Jeanne d’Arc conducts an annual world cruse as a training
ship for naval officers, but her secondary role was as an Anti-Submarine
Warfare command ship. At the start of the Northern Fury campaign she had
just departed Reunion island in the Indian Ocean where she had undergone
repairs to one of her engines.
