**FS Foch (R 99)**

The Foch is conducting trials using borrowed USN F/A-18A as a possible
replacement for the much delayed and problematic Rafale, which was
encountering yet more problems in development. The Foch’s Battle Group
escorts are somewhat dispersed at war start, either in port of
conducting other tasks off the south coast of France.
