**French Aircraft Carriers**

With the long and tortuous delays in building the Nuclear powered fleet
carrier ***'Charles De Gaulle'***, France's existing Aircraft Carrier
fleet has lingered into obsolescence.

The two Clemenceau class carriers were commissioned in the early 60's
and have already served 30 years. Less than half the size of American
Aircraft Carriers, and with dated air wings, these ships are suitable
for secondary roles only and are of limited value against a Soviet
threat. Both were based at Toulon on the Mediterranean.

Rounding out the French carrier team is a ship almost complete relegated
to officer training, but it does have a wartime Anti-Submarine Warfare
role (ASW). The ASW Helicopter Carrier Jeanne D'Arc is based in the
Atlantic at Brest but conducts annual world training tours, at the start
of Northern Fury she is returning home through the Indian Ocean. Of a
similar age and condition to the Clemenceau class, this ship is a cross
between a cruiser and a carrier, similar to the Soviet Moskva Class.
