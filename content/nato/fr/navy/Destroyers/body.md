**French Destroyers**

France classifies its escort ships by size and not function, therefore
each class is assigned a role, either ASW or Missile which are primarily
Air Defence (AD), the later classes are more universal in capability.
The terms Destroyer and Frigate are also used interchangeably with the
title of Frigate belonging to what other navies would term Offshore
Patrol Vessels.

[**Suffren
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/French-Navy/Destroyer-Frigate/Suffren-class.htm):
Built in the 1960s from the ground up as Air Defence ships, the primary
role of these two large ships is to protect the Clemenceau class
aircraft carriers. Both were modernized between 1989 and 1991 and carry
48 MASURCA Surface to Air Missiles (SAM), these are medium range French
designed and produced missiles that are unique to this class of ship.
(They were retrofitted onto the cruiser *Colbert* which retired in
1991).

[**Aconit**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/French-Navy/Destroyer-Frigate/D-609-FS-Aconit.htm):
This ship was to be the lead ship in a class of five and was designed
around two evolving technologies in the late 1960s; a Towed Array sonar
and the MALAFON ASW missile. Unfortunately, she took 5 years to build
and did not have helicopter facilities so the program was terminated.
She was upgraded in the mid-80s and received Exocet Anti-Ship Missiles
(ASM) and again in 1992 with a new Towed Array, some point defences
against missile and air attack. She is smaller than her successors but
works to augment ASW Task
Groups.

| **Pennant** | **Class** | **Ship** | **Status** | **Location** | **Role** | **Task** |

**[Tourville
Class](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/French-Navy/Destroyer-Frigate/Tourville-class.htm):**
These three ships are optimized for ASW and were essentially a larger
evolution of the Aconit class, equipped with two ASW helicopters and
fitted with the Crotale SAM system. They focus on ASW work in the North
Atlantic where they routinely perform admirably in company with NATO
ships.

| **Pennant** | **Class** | **Ship**      | **Status** | **Location** | **Role** | **Task** |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- |
| D 610       | Tourville | Tourville     | Active     | Atlantic     | ASW      |          |
| D 611       | Tourville | Duguay-Trouin | Active     | Atlantic     | ASW      |          |

[**Cassard
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/French-Navy/Destroyer-Frigate/Cassard-class.htm):
Built in 1988 and 1991 the two ships of this class are an AD variation
of the Georges Leygues Class of ASW ships. The two classes share the
same hull and many systems but the Cassard Class has a different
superstructure, weapons fit and propulsion system. Designed as a modern
AD ship able to fire the NATO(US) Standard SM-1MR SAM and capable of
coordinating airspace with NATO ships using the LINK-16 data
communications system, these ships are a major improvement in the AD
spectrum for the French Navy. They also carry one Lynx ASW helicopter
and have Exocet ASMs. Both are based in the Mediterranean and often
serve duty escorting the aircraft carriers along with the Suffern Class,
but are well rounded ships that can lead small Task Groups or act
independently.

| **Pennant** | **Class** | **Ship**  | **Status** | **Location** | **Role** | **Task** |
| ----------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- |
| D 614       | Cassard   | Cassard   | Active     | Med          | AAW      | Foch BG  |
| D 615       | Cassard   | Jean Bart | Active     | Med          | AAW      | Clem BG  |

[***Georges Leygues*
class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/French-Navy/Destroyer-Frigate/Georges-Leygues-class.htm):
Sharing the same hull as the Cassard class, the seven ships of this ASW
oriented design replace the medium range SAMs for shorter ranged Crotale
SAMs, a Towed Array Sonar and a second helicopter. These are well
rounded general purpose ships which are used in many
roles.
