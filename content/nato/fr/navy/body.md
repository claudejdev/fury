**The French Navy**

The French Navy is relatively large but stretched thin with global
commitments and is suffering from some dated technology. In addition to
maintaining its strategic Nuclear Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN)
the French Navy stations fleets both in the Atlantic and the
Mediterranean as well as routine global deployments. The Naval Air Arm
is of significant size but largely consists of older aircraft. The long
lead time for delivery of the Rafale fighter and the new aircraft
carrier (Charles de Gaulle) has put a strain on operational commitments
and readiness.
