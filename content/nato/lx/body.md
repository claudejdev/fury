Luxembourg is another of the 12 founding members of NATO but it does not
maintain a significant military force.

**Land force**: Luxembourg keeps a single Battalion with two Rifle
Companies, a School Company and an HQ Company with some heavy weapons,
primarily as an internal security force.

**Air Force**: Luxembourg does not have an air force; however, the fleet
of 18 NATO E-3 AWACs is registered here and operated by a multinational
force based in Geilenkirchen Germany.

**Note:** On 14 July 1996, NATO E-3A, LX-N90457, overran the runway and
crashed into the sea on takeoff from Preveza AB, Preveza, Greece. This
happens after the Northern Fury campaign so all 18 airframes are
available.
