Spain was the last country to join NATO once its democratic restoration
gained enough momentum following the Dictator Franco's death in 1975. A
national referendum on the subject and although opposed by a strong
socialist opposition party, which came into government later that year,
the plebiscite voted for joining NATO.

Spain has fractious relationships with the United Kingdom over Gibraltar
and Portugal over the Savage Islands and the town of Olivenza on the
border between the two countries. Other NATO countries have deep seated
issues over Spain's fascist history which required significant work to
overcome during its integration with the military alliance. Close
relations with the US and France however, counterbalanced these issues,
the major US fleet base at Rota Spain and air facilities in the Canary
Islands ensure continued US support.

Other territorial disputes with Morocco have a minor impact on the
Spanish Military, in particular Perejil Island in the Strait of
Gibraltar, several other small islands and the Spanish held territories
of Ceuta and Melilla.
