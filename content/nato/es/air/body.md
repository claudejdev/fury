**Spanish Air Force**

The Spanish Air Force (*Ejército del Aire, or Army of the Air) has
undergone significant transition since the death of Francisco Franco in
1975, the transition to democracy and joining NATO in 1982. Initially
equipped with F-4 Phantoms, F-5 Freedom Fighters, and Mirage aircraft,
the investment in the EF-18 has propelled the Spanish Air Force into the
modern era.*

**EF-18 Hornet:**

The fighting core of the Spanish Airforce is the EF-18A, with four
operational Squadrons and a training squadron in two wings. Spain
obtained 60 ‘A+’ and 12 ‘B+ versions of the aircraft, prefixed as EF
these aircraft are very close to the ‘C/D’ standard allowing them to
employ a modern suite of precision munitions, however they are limited
to the Aim-7F Sparrow missile for air to air combat. An attempt
(historically successful) to acquire a further 24 ex-US Navy Hornets has
been thwarted by US requirements to expand its inventory of F/A-18s.

**Mirage F.1:**

Since 1975, one of the mainstays of the Spanish Air Force has been the
Mirage F.1, many have been phased out but 48 of the original 91
airframes remain. Of these all have been upgraded to the ‘F.1M’ standard
and half have been modified to the ‘EE’ interceptor role and the
remainder are the ‘CE’ standard focusing on Close Air Support
(CAS)

Build in Europe and modified for the Spanish Airforce, the remaining
versions are all upgraded ‘B’ model two seaters or the last single seat
which are reconnaissance versions but upgraded from the fighter version
and retaining the original gun. In addition to Close Air Support these
aircraft provide training to future EF-18 pilots.

**P-3B:** Spain purchased 5 P-3B’s from Norway in 1989 and operates them
from Moron Air Base.

**CN-212 and CN-235:** These home grown Spanish transport aircraft
developed by CASA and IPTN before these two companies were purchased by
Airbus. The CN-235 began production in 1986 began replacing the CN-212
the same year. Both have Electronic Warfare, Photo Reconnaissance,
Search and Rescue, and Maritime Patrol variants but in 1994 these
functions remained with the CN-212 while the CN-235 was quickly
replacing the cargo variants.

**Falcon 20:** This French built executive jet serves the Portuguese,
and many other European nations, as an Electronic warfare aircraft.

**C-130H**: The ubiquitous Hercules serves the Spanish Air Force as both
a Tactical Transport (8) and an areal refueling tanker (5).

**Boing 707B**: The one example of the venerable 707 in the Spanish Air
Force serves as a refueling tanker.

**F-27:** These three light twin engine turbo prop serves as a Search
and Rescue aircraft.
