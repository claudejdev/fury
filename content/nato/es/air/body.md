**Spanish Air Force**

The Spanish Air Force (*Ejército del Aire, or Army of the Air)* has
undergone significant transition since the death of Francisco Franco in
1975, the shift to democracy and joining NATO in 1982. Always depending
on the west for equipment Spain replaced its F-86 and T-33 with F-4
Phantoms, F-5 Freedom Fighters, and Mirage in the 1960s and now the
investment in the EF-18 has propelled the Spanish Air Force into the
modern era. Because of past difficulties with obtaining aircraft or
replacement parts from the US, Spain maintains a policy of ensuring that
it holds both European (primarily French) as well as US fighters at all
times.

The fighting core of the Spanish Airforce is the EF-18A, with four
operational Squadrons plus a training group. Spain obtained 60 ‘A+’ and
12 ‘B+ versions of the aircraft, prefixed as EF these aircraft are very
close to the ‘C/D’ standard allowing them to employ a modern suite of
precision ground attack munitions, however they are limited to the
Aim-7F Sparrow missile for air to air combat. An attempt (historically
successful) to acquire a further 24 ex-US Navy Hornets has been thwarted
by US requirements to expand its inventory of F/A-18s. Each Squadron
operates at least two EF-18B in addition to its single seat fighters.

[**Mirage F.1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Mirage_F1)

Since 1975, one of the mainstays of the Spanish Air Force has been the
Mirage F.1. Of the original 91 airframes, 48 remain in service. All of
these have been upgraded to the ‘F.1M’ standard; half have been modified
to the ‘EE’ interceptor role, and the remainder are the ‘CE’ standard
focusing on Close Air Support (CAS)

Fighter**](http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f5_24.html)

These Freedom Fighters are built in Europe and modified for the Spanish
Airforce, the 20 remaining strike versions are all upgraded ‘B’ model
two seaters while the last single seat reconnaissance versions are
upgraded from the fighter version and retaining the original gun. In
addition to Close Air Support these aircraft provide training to future
EF-18 pilots.

them from Moron Air Base.

**CN-212 and CN-235**

These are home grown Spanish transport aircraft developed by CASA and
IPTN before these two companies were purchased by Airbus. The CN-235
entered production in 1986 began replacing the CN-212 the same year.
Both have Electronic Warfare, Photo Reconnaissance, Search and Rescue,
and Maritime Patrol variants but in 1994 these functions remained with
the CN-212 while the CN-235 was quickly replacing the cargo variants.

**Falcon 20**

This French built executive jet serves the Portuguese, and many other
European nations, as an Electronic warfare aircraft.

**C-130H**

The ubiquitous Hercules serves the Spanish Air Force as both a Tactical
Transport (8) and an areal refueling tanker (5).

**Boing 707B**: The one example of the venerable 707 in the Spanish Air
Force serves as a refueling tanker.

**F-27:** These three light twin engine turbo prop serves as a Search
and Rescue aircraft.
