**Spanish Naval Aviation**

The primary focus of Spanish Naval Aviation is providing aircraft for
operations on board ships, both the *Príncipe de Asturias* and other
ships in the fleet. The Spanish Air Force operates the fleet of P-3Bs
and other Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) and Sea Air Rescue (SAR)
/assets. All /assets are based at NAS Rota.

Spain’s 9<sup>th</sup> Escuadrilla operates 12 AV-8B Harrier II’s,
called the EAV-8S Matador, as the *Príncipe de Asturias’* main strike
element. A 13<sup>th</sup> aircraft is available for shore based
training, maintenance training and emergency replacement at Rota. These
are the ‘Day Only’ Aim-9 equipped versions, however an order has been
placed to upgrade them to the ‘+’ standard. Unfortunately, this will not
happen during Northern Fury.

[**SH-70B-1
Seahawk**](https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/s70b-seahawk/)

These 12 new Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopters operating off of
the six Santa María-class frigates are provided by the 10<sup>th</sup>
Escuadrilla. Essentially the same as the American SH-60B, these aircraft
work with the Oliver Hazard Perry based Frigates and provide a powerful
ASW system to protect the aircraft carrier or on independent patrol.

The Spanish Navy operates three different versions of Sea King. The
initial purchase was for 18x SH-3D, and between that time and 1994, six
of these were written off. Eight of the remaining 12 were upgraded to
the SH-3H (HS.9) standard, to carry on ASW work, while the last four
were converted to SH-3G utility/transport versions. Further, in 1985,
three were converted to SH-3W for Airborne Early Warning (AEW). All are
operated by 5<sup>th</sup> Escuadrilla and the ‘H’ and ‘W’ variants
operate off the Principe de Asturias.

**AB212**

3<sup>rd</sup> Escuadrilla operate two versions of this versatile
helicopter. Of the original 8 obtained for ASW work, four remain in that
task, while the four others were converted to Electronic Warfare (EW).
These aircraft would work either off of the aircraft carrier or on
special missions as none of the other Frigates were able to house a
helicopter.

**Hughes 500ASW Defender**

Used for local ASW tasks or for short journeys on the Serviola-class
patrol boat, 6<sup>th</sup> Escuadrilla operated six of these small
aircraft.

as several other small transport aircraft for general transport tasks.
