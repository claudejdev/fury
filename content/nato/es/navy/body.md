**Spanish Navy**

The Spanish Navy is relatively small but well rounded. The addition of
the *Príncipe de Asturias* aircraft carrier in the late 80s opened a new
and more prominent phase for the navy which had concentrated on blue
water Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) work in the eastern Atlantic since
joining NATO.

Launched in 1988 and modernized with new radars in 1990 this ship, the
flagship of the Spanish Navy, is very modern and capable. She carries 8
AV-8B Harrier II, 8 Sea Kings, 4 AB-212 and 2 Sea King AEW. At war start
she is conducting a port visit to Rio de Janeiro as part of a 4 month
tour aimed at training and validating the use of the Spanish Navy’s new
AOR (A-14 Patiño).

[**Santa María-class
frigate**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Spanish-Navy/Frigate/Santa-Maria-class.htm)

The six ships of this class are based on the US Oliver Hazard Perry with
a wider beam and a different close in weapons suite. These ships are all
less than 10 years old and the final batch were purchased earlier in
Northern Fury so all are available by the end of 1993, although F86
Canarias is still undergoing sea trials.

[**Baleares Class
Frigate**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleares-class_frigate)

These five ships are based on the US Knox class but much improved with
‘Standard’ air defence missiles and improved sonar, unfortunately all
this was at the cost of helicopter facilities.

[**Descubierta-class
Corvette**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descubierta-class_corvette)

The six 1500 ton corvettes or Patrol Frigates of the Descubierta class
primarily focus on surface warfare, with only limited short range air
defence and ASW capability. These ships are a cost effective expedient
to patrol Spain’s long coastline or show the flag on occasional
international missions.

[**Serviola-class patrol
boat**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serviola-class_patrol_boat)

The four ships in this class were all commissioned in 91 and 92. They
are designed for offshore patrol and are able to maintain operations in
heavy seas. They can operate a helicopter although none are normally
embarked but they do normally deploy with two RHIBs.

**Amphibious forces**

The Spanish Navy has a small Marine Brigade (Tercio de Armada) of two
battalions, two artillery batteries, a tank company with M48 Patton
tanks, amphibious tractors and various other elements. Unfortunately,
there is very little in the way of amphibious landing capability; two
Dock Landing Ships are being designed, and the two ‘Newport’ class LSTs
destined for Spain were retained by the US. Spain has the following
amphibious ships, all based at Rota:

-   2x 1950’s era Attack Transports of WW2 design

-   3x 1950s era LSTs of WW2 design

-   2x LCU 1466

-   3x K class LCT

-   Various landing craft

**Submarines**

[**Agosta Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/agosta_class.htm)

These four French designed Submarines are very capable SSK or
conventionally powered attack submarines. These boats have the endurance
for long journeys and routinely patrol thorough the Mediterranean and
beyond.

**[Daphné-class](http://www.military-today.com/navy/daphne_class.htm)**

The four Daphne class submarines are older and smaller than the Agosta’s
but their 8 forward and 4 stern firing torpedo tubes make for an
impressive first strike on a group of targets. Used primarily for costal
patrolling on both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coast of Spain.

**Service Ships**

**AOR A-14 Patiño**

A new ship, and new type for the Spanish Fleet is the Fast Replenishment
Oiler (AOR) Patiño. Designed specifically to provide mission support to
the Príncipe de Asturias aircraft carrier and its escort, allowing them
to venture globally rather than being confined to the Mediterranean and
Eastern Atlantic or relying on allies. This ship was historically
commissioned in 1995 but in Northern Fury with funds freed up by not
purchasing American amphibious ships, she was laid down a year earlier
and commissioned 18 months earlier than in the real world. A sister
ship, the Cantabria (A15) is planned but not yet ordered.
