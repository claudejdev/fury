**Spanish Navy**\n\n![](images/spain navy/imagen001.jpg)**R-11 Príncipe de Asturias**: Launched in 1988 and modernized with new radars in 1990 this ship, the flagship of the Spanish Navy is very modern and capable. She carries 8 AV-8B Harrier II, 8 Sea Kings, 4 AB-212 and 2 Sea King AEW. At war start she is conducting a port visit to Rio de Janeiro as part of a 4 month tour aimed at training and validating the use of the Spanish Navy‘s new AOR (A-14 Patiño).\n\n![](images/spain navy/imagen002.jpg)**Santa María-class frigate**: The six ships of this class are based on the US Oliver Hazard Perry class with a wider beam and a different close in weapons suite. These ships are all less than 10 years old and the final batch were purchased earlier in Northern Fury so all are available by the end of 1993, although F86 Canarias is still undergoing sea trials.\n\nPennant\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nF 81\n\nSanta Maria\n\nPersian Gulf\n\nF 82\n\nVictoria\n\nTied Up\n\nF 83\n\nNumancia\n\nUSS Eisenhower Gp\n\nF 84\n\nReina Sofia\n\nP de Asturias Gp\n\nF 85\n\nNavarra\n\nWestern Med\n\nF 86\n\nCanarias\n\nWorkups Rota\n\n![](images/spain navy/imagen003.jpg)**Baleares Class Frigate**: These five ships are based on the US Knox class but much improved with ‘Standard‘ air defence missiles and improved sonar, but this was at the cost of helicopter facilities.\n\nPennant\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nF 71\n\nBaleares\n\nOff Gibraltar\n\nF 72\n\nAndalucia\n\nWestern Med\n\nF 73\n\nCataluna\n\nCTF 150 Somalia\n\nF 74\n\nAsturias\n\nP de Asturias Gp\n\nF 75\n\nExtremadura\n\nTied Up\n\n![](images/spain navy/imagen004.jpg)**Descubrta-class Corvette**: The six 1500 ton corvettes or Patrol Frigates of the Descubierta class primarily focus on surface warfare, with only limited short range air defence and ASW capability. These ships are a cost effective expedient to patrol Spain‘s long coastline or show the flag on occasional international missions.\n\nPennant\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nF 31\n\nDecubierta\n\nOff Gibraltar\n\nF 32\n\nDiana\n\nCaribbean\n\nF 33\n\nInfanta Elena\n\nTied Up\n\nF 34\n\nInfanta Cristina\n\nCoruna\n\nF 35\n\nCazadora\n\nEastern Med\n\nF 36\n\nVencedora\n\nRefit\n\n![](images/spain navy/imagen005.jpg)**Serviola-class patrol boat**: The four ships in this class were all commissioned in 91 and 92. They are designed for offshore patrol and are able to maintain operations in heavy seas, operate a helicopter although none are normally embarked and deploy its two RHIBs.\n\nPennant\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nP 71\n\nServiola\n\nBay of Biscay\n\nP 72\n\nCentinela\n\nTied Up\n\nP 73\n\nVigia\n\nOff Vigo\n\nP 74\n\nAtalaya\n\nTied Up\n\n**Amphibious forces**: The Spanish Navy has a small Marine Brigade (Tercio de Armada) of two battalions, two artillery batteries, a tank company with M48 Patton tanks, amphibious tractors and various other elements. Unfortunately there is very little in the way of amphibious landing capability; two Dock Landing Ships are being designed, two ‘Newport‘ class LSTs were retained by the US and not sold to Spain. Therefore, Spain has the following, all based at Rota:\n\n* 2x 1950‘s era Attack Transports of WW2 design\n* 3x 1950‘s era LSTs of WW2 design\n* 2x LCU 1466\n* 3x K class LCT\n\* Various landing craft\n\n![](images/spain navy/imagen006.jpg)\n\nUSS Paul Revere (APA-248), sold to Spain in 1980 as L-21 Castilla (L-21)\n\n![](images/spain navy/imagen007.jpg)\n\nL11 Velasco ex US LST-1156 Terrebonne Parish\n\n![](images/spain navy/imagen008.jpg)**Agosta Class Submarines**: These four French designed Submarines are very capable SSK or conventionally powered attack submarines.

Used primarily for costal patrolling on both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coast of Spain.\n\nPennant\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nS 61\n\nDelfin\n\nBay of Biscay\n\nS 62\n\nTonina\n\nTied Up\n\nS 63\n\nMarsopa\n\nOff Gibraltar\n\nS 64\n\nNarval\n\nTied Up\n\n![](images/spain navy/imagen010.jpg)**AOR A-14 Patiño**: The new ship, and new type for the Spanish Fleet is the Fast Replenishment Oiler (AOR) Patiño. Designed specifically to provide mission support to the Príncipe de Asturias aircraft carrier and its escort, allowing them to venture globally rather than being confined to the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic or relying on allies. This ship was historically commissioned in 1995 but in Northern Fury with funds freed up by not purchasing the American amphibious ships, she was laid down a year earlier and commissioned 18 months earlier than in the real world. A sister ship, the Cantabria (A15) is planned but not yet ordered.
