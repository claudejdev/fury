**Turkish Air Force**

The Turkish Air Force maintains a large but mixed inventory, with over
550 aircraft in operations, about 380 of which are combat types.

[**F-16**](http://www.f-16.net/f-16_users_article21.html)

After receiving the first eight examples from the US under the Peace
Onyx I program Turkey builds its own F-16 under licence. The first batch
was F-16 Block 30 (34 ‘C’ & 9 ‘D’) airframes in 1987/90 - a mirror of
the Greek Peace Xenia I program. TUSAS Aerospace Industries (TAI)
continued to produce F-16 Block 40 to fill out the full order of 132
airframes by adding 102 ‘C’ and 15 more ‘D’ to the inventory. The F-16
has almost completely replaced the F-104G and most of the F-5A fleet
taking over both the air superiority and ground support tasks.

[**F-4
Phantom**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F-4_Phantom_II)

The F-4 was widely used in the Turkish Air Force, primarily for Air
Superiority but also for reconnaissance and now, with the F-16 arriving,
it is taking up the ground support role.

[**F-5 Freedom
Fighter**](http://www.the-northrop-f-5-enthusiast-page.info/AirForces/TurkeyAF.html)

Turkey retained over 100 F-5A/B but did not receive additional airframes
from Canada, Norway and the Netherlands in the late 80s and early 90s as
they did historically; therefore, these aircraft are nearing the end of
their usable life. The 133<sup>rd</sup> Filo is the air demonstration
team, the ‘Turkish Stars’.

**Transport Aircraft**

Turkey’s geography demands a fairly large air transport fleet, primarily
provided by three main types and augmented by a small fleet of executive
jets. The CN-235s are just coming into service and 36 of an eventual 52
have been delivered, in addition to the squadrons listed here, these are
distributed amongst all other wings and bases to provide liaison and Sea
Air Rescue (SAR)
flights.

| --- | ------------ | ------ | -------- | -- | ----------- | ------------- |

Turkey has a large flight training wing located near Izmir that conducts
the full gamut of flight
training.
