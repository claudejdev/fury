Turkey became a member of NATO in 1952 in conjunction with is geographic
neighbor and long term rival, Greece. Turkey is a large country with a
large population and the only NATO country not in Europe proper but in
Asia, except the small area (3% of Turkish land mass) variously called
European Turkey, Eastern Thrace or Turkish Thrace. The Turkish military
is also quite large; the second largest in NATO and it borders both the
Soviet Union and Bulgaria. Turkey also controls the entrance to the
Black Sea through the two important straights, the Bosporus and
Dardanelles, thus limiting Soviet ability to influence the
Mediterranean. Strategically then, Turkey is the key to southern Europe
and essential to NATO’s capacity to control its southern flank, no doubt
a significant factor in NATO’s meek reaction to the Turkish invasion of
Cyprus in 1974.

Turkey’s relationship with Greece has been a constant source of friction
throughout recent history and certainly within NATO, but it’s difficult
to say how this would develop under the pressures of conflict. The
multi-national NATO command structure was not built to put eithers
troops, ships or air elements under command of the other. Turkey retains
command of its land forces through Allied Land Forces South Eastern
Europe (LANDSOUTHEAST) headquartered in Izmir, and reporting directly to
Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSouth); Sixth Allied Tactical Air Force
(6 ATAF) also in Izmir and Commander North Eastern Mediterranean
(COMEDNOREAST) in Ankara commands its naval forces. Greece had
equivalent commands all reporting to Naples.
