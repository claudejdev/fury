Although the Danish Navy is focused on plugging the exit from the Baltic Sea into the Atlantic through the Skagerrak. The overseas responsibilities that Denmark has for Greenland and the Faroes islands which demand an ocean going navy.

The most important ships in the Danish Navy are the Niels Juel class Corvettes, actually small Frigates.

| Pennant | Ship               | Status | Location |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ | -------- |
| F 354   | Niels Juel         | Active | Atlantic |
| F 355   | Olfert Fischer     | Active | Atlantic |
| F 356   | Peter Tordenskiold | Active | Atlantic |

Niels Juel Class

**Offshore Patrol Vessels**: Essentially Frigates capable of long range, long duration patrols. The singleton ship Beskytteren was followed by the very modern and capable Thetis class.

Thetis Class

#### Light Forces

In the confined waters of the Baltic approaches, the cut and thrust of light forces is critical. Using islands and narrow seas to shadow radar signatures, hide ambushing craft and allowing for quick escape lends itself to small, fast and powerful craft.

The Flyvefisken class was a modern, configurable class which was a new and novel concept for most navies. Built to either be either a Mine Countermeasures ship or a Combat craft, Northern Fury has both Series 1 and 2 completed by January 1994.
