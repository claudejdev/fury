**Turkish Navy**

The Turkish Navy, similar to the Greek was a casualty of increased
tensions. Historically the Turks started to receive cast off US Knox
class Frigates in 1993, not to mention plans for several Oliver Hazard
Perry class later in the decade. Of course these ships were not
forthcoming because the USN was holding onto them. The Germans did sell
Turkey their old Koln class Frigates (Classified as destroyers in
Turkey), but the general lack of hulls available meant holding onto
three Yucetepe class ships which are already well beyond their usable
life.

**Destroyers**

**Ex Gearing Class**: Ten of the original 13 Gearing class Destroyers
received from the US in the 1970s and early 80s remain in service. Some
of these are World War Two veterans and are approaching 50 years old,
although tired they have been modernized. Turkey holds ships that
generally fall into three sub classes. The Fleet Rehabilitation and
Modernization (FRAM) program produced two main variants: The FRAM I
ships of the Yucetep Class focused on Anti-Surface warfare (ASuW) while
the one remaining FRAM II ship and the two of the Alcitepe (Carpenter)
class focused on Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) operations.

[**Gelibolu Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Köln-class_frigate):
These two Ex Koln class ships arrived from Germany in the 1980s. Turkey
ended up purchasing four of this six ship class originally commissioned
in the 60s, but one ship was destroyed in a fire and another was used
for spare parts. The two ships in service provide important and reliable
ASW work to augment the fleet of aging Gearings. These ships do not have
missiles and rely on guns only for defence, but their ASW suites are
reasonable.

**Frigates**

[**Yavuz Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavuz-class_frigate)
**(MEKO 200)**: This modern class is a German designed modular warship
with several variations, in three basic configurations (MEKO 140, 200,
360). The MEKO 200 is the most prolific with six nations either
operating or building the design. The Turkish Navy’s Yavuz Class are
large (3,000 tons) capable and well-rounded ships with Harpoon ASMs, Sea
Sparrow air defence missiles, 3x Oerlikon Sea Zenith 25mm Close In
Weapons Systems (CIWS), a 5” gun and facilities for an AB-212 ASW
helicopter. The four ships were delivered in 1987-89 with two being
built in Germany and the last two in Turkey. Plans to build another four
of these ships are maturing for later in the decade.

**Fast Attack Craft**

[**Dogan, Ruzgar
Class**](http://www.navalanalyses.com/2014/06/dogan-ruzgar-and-yildiz-class-fast.html):
These two classes are almost identical, they are high speed (40 Knots),
well-armed craft that are primarily built for the defence of the
Bosporus approaches. Equipped with up to eight Harpoon Surface to
Surface Missiles (SSM) for anti-shipping attack, an OTO Melara 76mm gun
and twin 35mm AAA as well as electronic and physical countermeasures,
these are very powerful ships.

[**Kartal
Class**](http://www.navalanalyses.com/2014/07/kartal-class-fast-attack-crafts-of.html):
Based on the German Zobel class torpedo boats, nine were built in
Germany in 1968-70, however one was lost (P 325 Meltem) in a collision
with a Soviet navy ship in 1985. Armed with four Penguin Mk 2 missiles
and two torpedoes along with two 40mm auto cannons for self-defence,
these boats can move in at 40 knots and engage targets out to 34 Km
range, impressive for such a small boat.

**Amphibious Vessels:** All of these ships have pennant numbers prefixed
with NL, indicating that they have a secondary role of mine layer (N) in
addition to their primary role of landing ship (L)

[**Osman Gazi
LST**](http://www.navalanalyses.com/2014/10/osman-gazi-class-landing-ship-minelayer.html):
These two ships (the second was historically canceled) were accelerated
into service with the second being accepted in commission as Northern
Fury commences. This is a capable Landing Ship which can carry 900
troops and 15 tanks. It has 20mm and 40mm self-defence AAA.

**Bey Class LST**: Three Turkish built vessels that can carry 600 troops
and 11 tanks and 2 Landing Craft

**Bayraktar/Ertuğrul Class LST**: These two Ex-US Terrebonne Parish
class vessels can carry 400 troops and 10 tanks.

**LCT**: Six Ex British LCT Mk IV, 31 Ex French EDIC type LCT, 15 Ex US
LCU, 30 Ex-US LCM-8 and about 16 Ex Turkish built LCTs.

five 1,000 ton ships are converted specifically for mine laying.

**Mine Sweepers**: Turkey does not have any Mine Hunters but has a
variety of older mine sweepers of US, French and Canadian origin, some
received third hand from other users. The primary role is to keep the
shipping channel through the Bosporus and Dardanelles open.

**Submarines**:

Turkey operates a sizable submarine force but only the Atilay (Type
209/1200) class can be considered modern and capable. The remainder hail
from the Post World War Two era and are ready for retirement. A more
modern class yet, the Preveze (Type 209/1400) class is due to start
entering service later in 1994, allowing the older boats to be put to
rest. Turkey is destined to be the largest operator of the Type 209
boats in the world but they are not yet there in 1994.

[**Atilay Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_209_submarine):
These are German Type 209/1200 boats; quiet, small, efficient and
maneuverable. Armed with torpedoes, mines and/or Harpoon SSMs these are
perfect submarines for the confined waters of the Black or Aegean Sea.

**Guppy/Tang Class**: There are three older classes of submarine in
operation. Two versions of the GUPPY (Greater Underwater Propulsion
Power System) class and the Tang class, all ex-USN boats built in the
early 1950s. All of these boats were developments on World War Two
German designs and were evolutionary in nature. For our purposes they
have about the same capabilities, the Tang is a derivative of the GUPPY
types and is therefore slightly more capable and also larger. None can
hope to survive long in a modern conflict with capable ASW forces.

**Service Ships**: The Turkish Navy has one replenishment Oiler in
service and one building. This ship allows the Turkish Navy to venture
beyond its traditional patrol areas and complete tasks world-wide. The
[Akar
class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akar-class_replenishment_oiler)
carries 16,000 tons of fuel and a small amount of dry goods.
