**Turkish Army**

The Turkish Army is the second largest in NATO, although technologically
it lags well behind many other alliance members. There are 525,000 full
time personnel in the Army with a further 950,000 available in reserve;
probably 700,000 of those are ready for immediate recall. Structurally
there are four Army level commands and ten Corps. 1<sup>st</sup> Army in
Thrace holds the most armor and together with 3<sup>rd</sup> Army in the
Caucasus are the largest and maintain the highest readiness.
2<sup>nd</sup> Army guards the critical Bosporus/Dardanelles area and
will induct most of the reserve formations to reinforce east or west as
needed; while 4<sup>th</sup> Army conducts rear area and civil defence
tasks. Additionally, there are 110,000 Gendarmerie consisting of 67
‘regiments’ which will fall under the control of 4<sup>th</sup> Army or
come under command of the National HQ during wartime.
