**Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF)**

The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) conducts a wide range of operations
from Defence of North America under the NORAD (North American Air
Defence) treaty and NATO tasks with a wing of CF-18s in Germany, to
maritime patrol, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and search and rescue
working with the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), to providing the Army with
its tactical aviation.

**CF-18**

In the 1980’s Canada took delivery of 138 CF-18’s (98 CF-18A and 40 twin
seat CF-18B). The two main roles for these aircraft were NORAD patrols
in Canada’s arctic and the standing NATO deployment in Baden Sollingen
Germany.

1<sup>st</sup> Canadian Air Division (1 CAD) based in Baden Sollingen
Germany consisted of two wings operated under control of **Fourth Allied
Tactical Air Force** **(4 ATAF)**. 4 Wing was permanently established in
Baden and consisted of three squadrons while 3 Wing was a ‘Flyover’ wing
which was to deploy regularly or in periods of tension, consisting of
two squadrons, one each from Cold Lake Alberta and Bagotville Quebec.

The **NORAD** Squadrons would operate under the control of the
**Canadian NORAD Region (CANR)** and would disperse to the Arctic and
bases on each coast in groups of six aircraft (6-Pack) each.

[**CF-5**](http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f5_21.html)

Introduced in the late 60’s the CF-5 Freedom Fighter was due to be
replaced by the CF-18. Only two squadrons remain even though 135
examples were initially built. In 1988 23x CF-5A and 33x CF-5D received
a major upgrade and structural overhaul, and in 1990, a further Avionics
Upgrade (AUP) was provided to 46 aircraft (13 CF-5A, 33 CF-5D).
Historically this second upgrade was terminated after 37 aircraft were
complete but in Northern Fury they were all completed. Both remaining
squadrons (434 Sqn was historically disbanded in 89 but remains here)
fly a multitude of missions: Advanced fighter training and lead-in
training for CF-18 pilots; Close Air Support (CAS) for the Army,
Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT) against the CF-18s and aggressor
training against the Navy. Each squadron operates about 26 of the
strengthened aircraft, more than half of them dual seat ‘D’ versions,
mostly with the AUP upgrade.

| Sqn | Name     | A/C | Type        | Base       |
|-----|----------|-----|-------------|------------|
| 419 | Moose    | 26  | CF-5A/D/AUP | Cold Lake  |
| 434 | Bluenose | 26  | CF-5A/D/AUP | Chatham NB |

**CP-140 Aurora**

The Canadian version of the ubiquitous P-3 Orion also mounts the
electronics suite of the S-3 Viking allowing for a more varied mission
set. 18 CP-140s were built plus 3 CP-140A Arcturus used primarily for
training and fisheries patrols.

**Maritime Helicopter**

Canada operates a fleet of Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King in the ship-borne
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) role. In total 41 aircraft were in
operation all of them upgraded in the mid 1980’s. Historically six were
fitted with a Magnetic Anomaly Detection (MAD) system for deployment to
the Gulf war, this was designated as the CH-124B and in Northern Fury 12
have been converted with this upgrade.
