**Canadian Arm**y

The Canadian army fields a Division sized force with four active Brigade
Groups, three within the Division and the Special Service Force (SSF)
acting in several other roles. The Div HQ, 1<sup>st</sup> and
5<sup>th</sup> Brigades will deploy to Germany to join 4<sup>th</sup>
Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (CMBG) to form the Corps reserve for
VII US Corps. Historically 4<sup>th</sup> CMBG returned to Canada in
1993 with the end of the Cold War, however this does not happen in
Northern Fury.

The SSF has elements assigned to the AMF (ACE \[Allied Command Europe\]
Mobile Force) and expected to deploy to North Norway in an emergency, it
also has defence of North America and domestic tasks.

**Leopard I**

![](/assets/images/nato/ca/army/image2.jpg)The main battle tank of
the Canadian Army is the Leopard IA3. The 114 tanks are primarily in
Germany with 78 of them forming the 8<sup>th</sup> Canadian Hussars. The
remainder are in Gagetown New Brunswick as a training Cadre. The
Canadian based armoured units are equipped with ‘Cougars’ but trained on
Leopards.

**AVGP**

The Armoured Vehicle General Purpose (AVGP) was a family of vehicles
based on the Swiss Piranha. Canada purchased 195 ‘Cougar’ variants with
a 76mm low velocity gun, and 274 ‘Grizzly’ versions to act as Armoured
Personnel Carriers, augmenting the fleet of M113s already in service.
These vehicles were generally underpowered, lacking in firepower, small
and unpopular. They were not meant for service outside of Canada, but
there was no effective plan to re-equip the force in times of emergency
and they deployed to Bosnia, Croatia, Somalia and

missions - so they would undoubtedly be deployed to Europe in Northern
Fury.

M109

Canada operated 76 M109A4B+ howitzers, with 24 equipping 1<sup>st</sup>
Regiment Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA) in Germany and two
regiments of 18 guns each in Canada supporting the other two Bdes of the
Division.
