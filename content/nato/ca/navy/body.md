Canada‘s Navy was primarily focused on ASW work in the North Atlantic, although a Squadron was always available in the Pacific to work with the US 7th Fleet.

**Tribal Class Destroyers**: These four ships had just finished a mid life modernization program (TRUMP - Tribal Update and Modernization Project), making them quite capable. These ships routinely operated as a flagship for ASW task groups or within the ASW escort of a US CVBG.

The Halifax Class Frigates represented a long awaited infusion of modern capabilities into the RCN. In Northern Fury, four (of 12) member of this class are available, with three more being commissioned three months early and arriving for operations during the campaign. The remaining five will be commissioned beyond the scope of Northern Fury.

The ships the Halifax class was replacing were all commissioned in the late ‘50s or early ‘60s and were of marginal capability at best. Representing four different classes these 14 ships were all due for retirement after over 30 years of hard use in the North Atlantic or North Pacific. Essentially they remained active as life support systems for very effective towed array variable depth sonars (VDS) and the Sea King Helicopter carried on 6 of them.
