**Royal Canadian Navy (RCN)**

Canada’s Navy was primarily focused on ASW work in the North Atlantic,
although a Squadron was always available in the Pacific to patrol the
west coast and work with the US 7th Fleet and Asian allies.

Class Destroyers**: These four ships had just finished a mid-life
modernization program (TRUMP - Tribal Update and Modernization Project),
making them quite capable. They routinely operated as a flagship for ASW
task groups or within the ASW escort of a US CVBG.

**Halifax (City) Class Frigates** represented a long-awaited infusion of
modern capabilities into the RCN. In Northern Fury, four (of 12) members
of this class are available, with three more being commissioned three
months early and arriving for operations during the campaign. The
remaining five will be commissioned beyond the scope of Northern Fury.

**The Steamers**: The ships the Halifax class was replacing were all
commissioned in the late ‘50s or early ‘60s and were of marginal
capability at best. Representing four different classes these 14 ships
were all due for retirement after over 30 years of hard use in the North
Atlantic or North Pacific. Essentially they remained active as life
support systems for very effective towed variable depth sonar array
(VDS) and the Sea King Helicopter carried on Annapolis and St Laurent
classes (6 Ships).

**Provider Class** The RCN also operated three replenishment oilers
(AO), the Provider was the prototype for the other two which are larger
and have improved systems, generally speaking there was one on each
coast with the third on the Atlantic coast either undergoing refit or
committed to NATO operations. These ships had strengthened hulls for
operations in icy waters but they were not icebreakers, they also have
accommodation for a Flag Officer and staff as well as an 8-bed hospital
and facilities for 3x CH-124 Sea King helicopters (Provider has 2).

The RCN operated three Oberon Class submarines
‘[O-Boats](https://maritime.org/doc/oberon/index.htm)’. All had recently
undergone an upgrade program (Submarine Operational Update Program
(SOUP)) and were ready for another decade of service. Ojibwa was built
to Royal Navy (RN) standards and modified before commissioning while the
other two were built from the keel up as Canadian Boats. Historically
two more O-Boats were acquired but not commissioned: HMS Olympus for
training and HMS Osiris for spare parts. While the Olympus arrived in
1989, Osiris remains in service with the RN. All three active boats are
based in Halifax.
