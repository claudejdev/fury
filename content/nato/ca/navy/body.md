Canada‘s Navy was primarily focused on ASW work in the North Atlantic, although a Squadron was always available in the Pacific to work with the US 7th Fleet.\n\n**Tribal Class Destroyers**: These four ships had just finished a mid life modernization program (TRUMP - Tribal Update and Modernization Project), making them quite capable. These ships routinely operated as a flagship for ASW task groups or within the ASW escort of a US CVBG.\n\nPennant\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nDDH 280\n\nIroquois\n\nActive\n\nAtlantic\n\nSTANAVFORLANT\n\nDDH 281\n\nHuron\n\nActive\n\nPacific\n\nDDH 282\n\nAthabaskan\n\nActive\n\nAtlantic\n\nDDH 283\n\nAlgonquin\n\nActive\n\nAtlantic\n\nStanding TG\n\n![](images/canada navy/HMCS_Iroquois_DDH_280.jpg)\n\nThe Halifax Class Frigates represented a long awaited infusion of modern capabilities into the RCN. In Northern Fury, four (of 12) member of this class are available, with three more being commissioned three months early and arriving for operations during the campaign. The remaining five will be commissioned beyond the scope of Northern Fury.\n\nPennant\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nAvailable\n\nFFH 330\n\nHalifax\n\nActive\n\nAtlantic\n\nFFH 331\n\nVancouver\n\nActive\n\nPacific\n\nFFH 332\n\nVille de Québec\n\nCommissioning\n\nAtlantic\n\nApr-94\n\nFFH 333\n\nToronto\n\nActive\n\nAtlantic\n\nFFH 334\n\nRegina\n\nActive\n\nPacific\n\nFFH 335\n\nCalgary\n\nBuilding\n\nJul-95\n\nFFH 336\n\nMontréal\n\nCommissioning\n\nAtlantic\n\nApr-94\n\nFFH 337\n\nFredericton\n\nCommissioning\n\nAtlantic\n\nMay-94\n\nFFH 338\n\nWinnipeg\n\nBuilding\n\nJun-96\n\nFFH 339\n\nCharlottetown\n\nBuilding\n\nSep-95\n\nFFH 340\n\nSt. John‘s\n\nBuilding\n\nJun-96\n\nFFH 341\n\nOttawa\n\nBuilding\n\nSep-96\n\n![](images/canada navy/HFX-Class-photo-768x511.jpg) \n\nThe ships the Halifax class was replacing were all commissioned in the late ‘50s or early ‘60s and were of marginal capability at best. Representing four different classes these 14 ships were all due for retirement after over 30 years of hard use in the North Atlantic or North Pacific. Essentially they remained active as life support systems for very effective towed array variable depth sonars (VDS) and the Sea King Helicopter carried on 6 of them.\n\nPennant\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nDDH 265\n\nAnnapolis\n\nAnnapolis\n\nActive\n\nPacific\n\nDDH 266\n\nAnnapolis\n\nNipigon\n\nActive\n\nAtlantic\n\nDDE 261\n\nMackenzie\n\nMackenzie\n\nTied Up\n\nPacific\n\nDDE 262\n\nMackenzie\n\nSaskatchewan\n\nTied Up\n\nPacific\n\nDDE 263\n\nMackenzie\n\nYukon\n\nTied Up\n\nPacific\n\nDDE 264\n\nMackenzie\n\nQu‘Appelle\n\nTied Up\n\nPacific\n\nDDE 236\n\nImp Restigouche\n\nGatineau\n\nActive\n\nPacific\n\nDDE 257\n\nImp Restigouche\n\nRestigouche\n\nActive\n\nPacific\n\nDDE 258\n\nImp Restigouche\n\nKootenay\n\nActive\n\nPacific\n\nDDE 259\n\nImp Restigouche\n\nTerra Nova\n\nActive\n\nPacific\n\nDDH 207\n\nSt Laurent\n\nSkeena\n\nActive\n\nAtlantic\n\nDDH 229\n\nSt Laurent\n\nOttawa\n\nTied Up\n\nAtlantic\n\nDDH 230\n\nSt Laurent\n\nMargaree\n\nTied Up\n\nAtlantic\n\nDDH 233\n\nSt Laurent\n\nFraser\n\nActive\n\nAtlantic\n\n![](images/canada navy/annapol1-300x233.jpg)\n\nAnnapolis Class\n\n \n\n![](images/canada navy/Mackenzie.jpg)\n\nMackenzie Class\n\n \n\n![](images/canada navy/restigou.jpg)\n\nImproved Restigouche Class\n\n \n\n![](images/canada navy/st-Laurent-768x660.jpg)\n\nSt Laurent Class\n\n \n\nThe RCN is also provided with replenishment oilers, the Provider was the prototype for the other two which are larger and have improved systems:\n\n![](images/canada navy/provider-300x221.jpg)\n\nHMCS Provider\n\n \n\nPennant\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nAOR 508\n\nProvider\n\nActive\n\nPacific\n\nAOR 509\n\nProtecteur\n\nActive\n\nAtlantic\n\nAOR 510\n\nPreserver\n\nActive\n\nAtlantic\n\n![](images/canada navy/preserve-300x180.jpg)\n\nHMCS Preserver\n\n \n\n**HMCS Preserver**: There were also three Oberon Class submarines in Canadian service.
