Although Iceland is one of the 12 founding members of NATO, it does not
maintain an armed forces, but relies on NATO forces stationed at the
strategic bases in and around Keflavik to defend its sovereignty. The
only force Iceland controls is its Coast Guard.

**The Icelandic Coast Guard** consists of two patrol ships, 4
helicopters and one fixed wing aircraft.

The two patrol ships of the Ægir class are the Ægir itself and the Týr,
they are only lightly armed but can support one of the four SA-365N-1
Dauphin 2 helicopters, although only for landing and fueling, they have
no hanger.

The single fixed wing asset is a Fokker F-27 used for maritime patrol
and search and rescue tasks.
