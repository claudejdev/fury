Norway is one of the 12 original members of the NATO alliance and was
initially the only one to share a boarder directly with the Soviet
Union. Turkey now shares that distinction since it joined in 1952. With
a population hovering around 5 million and having a long and vulnerable
coastline, Norway is dependent on NATO's collective defence assurances
for its survival. Even though its economy is small, Norway routinely
spends over 3% of its GDP on defence, 50% more than NATO requires.

NATO realizes the critical vulnerability of its northern flank and made
provision for rapid deployment to Norway. AMF (ACE \[Allied Command
Europe\] Mobile Force) is exercised annually sometimes in very large
scale, and the US Marine Corps and Air Force have pre-positioned
equipment at key locations in Norway. STANAVFORLANT (Standing Allied
Naval Force Atlantic) is also routinely deployed to Norwegian waters.
Regular training by British Royal Marines and US Marine Corps units on
Norwegian territory familiarized many involved with the intricacies of
fighting on Norway's rugged terrain. Finally, NATO E-3A AWACs aircraft
were almost continually stationed in Norway at Orland Air base

Norway's military is small but highly trained and well equipped to
utilize the advantage of terrain to counteract its disadvantage of
geography.
