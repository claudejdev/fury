**Norwegian Navy**

Norway‘s Navy is small but built specifically to operate within the
confined and turbulent waters of the North Sea along its long rocky and
mountainous coastline. Over 1000 miles (1750Km) stretch from the North
Cape to Stavanger in the south, causing Norway opt for many smaller
ships as opposed to a few larger and more expensive vessels.

[**Oslo Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo-class_frigate):
Although the largest and most capable ships in the Norwegian Navy, they
are small Frigates by most standards (1,700 tons). Built in the 1960’s
they’ve recently been modernized (late 80‘s) and are capable of a wide
range of general duties. These ships do not have a helicopter but rely
on shore based maritime aircraft to support them. They carry 6x Penguin
Anti-Ship Missiles (ASM) and an 8 cell Sea Sparrow launcher, a
short-range Surface to Air missiles (SAM) with 24 missiles in total. For
Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) they have torpedoes and both hull and
variable depth active sonar.

**Sleipner Class**: Dating from the same era as the Oslo class but
largely obsolete with the exception of an improved sonar installed in
the late 80‘s. The two Sleipner class Corvettes are used as training
ships and were due for retirement in 1993, but due to the increased
threat in the Northern Fury world, they were retained in service.

**Fast Attack Craft (FAC)**: The most potent arm of the Norwegian Navy
is its fleet of small, fast and deadly FACs. These boats use the rugged
and mountainous coastline for radar shielding while waiting to ambush
passing targets. Using their speed and missiles to deal a lethal blow
then running back into cover. Operating in small groups they use these
hit and run tactics is their main means of survival.

[**Storm
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm-class_patrol_boat): A class
of 20 boats that displace only 138 tons each, carry six Penguin I
Anti-Ship Missiles (ASM), and have a 76mm gun and 40mm auto-cannon. With
only a 20-man crew they can deploy quickly and travel at over 30 knots.

[**Snogg
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sn%C3%B8gg-class_missile_torpedo_boat):
Only six boats of this class were built, and they only carry four
Penguin I ASMs, but also four Torpedoes and one 40mm auto-cannon. They
are about the same size as the Storm class, have a crew of 19 and a
speed of over 30 knots.

[**Hauk Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauk-class_patrol_boat):
Larger (160 tons) and faster (32.5 knots) than the older boats, the 14
Hauk class carry six Penguin II missiles which have a longer range and
better seeker head than the original missile. These boats also carry
Mistral SAMs, a 40mm auto-cannon and two Torpedoes.

**Submarines: T**he proximity to the Soviet Union, the confined waters
and rugged coastlines, mean that the key method of defence is stealth
and ambush. The numerous FAC listed above are one method of achieving
this tactic, Hunter/Killer submarines (SSK) are another.

[**Ula Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/ula_class.htm): Built
in Germany and known as the Type 210, these have several improvements
over the very popular Type 209 boats. All six were commissioned between
1989 and 1992 and therefore are some of the most modern submarines
available at the start of Northern Fury. These are very stealthy and
dangerous SSKs which would give any enemy surface combatants pause to
consider the dangers of Norwegian waters.

[**Kobben
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobben-class_submarine): These
submarines were also built in Germany as the Type 207 and were an
improved version of the Type 205 used by Germany and Denmark. In total
15 boats were delivered to Norway between 1964 and 1967, but due to age,
accidents and decommissioning, only 8 remain in service at the start of
Northern Fury.

**Norwegian Coast Guard**: The Coast Guard is part of the Norwegian Navy
and takes responsibility for fisheries and shipping inspection, customs
and law enforcement, boarder control, environmental protection as well
as search and rescue. The wide ranging scope of duties keeps this very
small force quite busy. Much of the day to day work coastal work is
handled by ten small patrol ships of less than 1000 tones, seven of them
are chartered and each is armed with a 40mm Bofors gun. The one class of
larger ships is the **Nordkapp** class.

[**Nordkapp
Class**](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nordkapp-class_offshore_patrol_vessel):
These three Outer Coast Guard Ships, otherwise called Offshore Patrol
Vessels (OPV), are 3300 tones and twice the size of the Oslo class
Frigates, but have fewer weapons or sensors. Having strengthened hulls
to withstand limited ice crushing, or ice browsing they are well suited
to northern waters. Although they only carry a 57mm gun and machine
guns, in wartime they can be fitted with Depth Charges, Penguin
anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, 20mm guns and Mistral SAMs. The peacetime
crew is 52 plus 6 for the air detachment, but its wartime establishment
is 76 and there is bunk space for 109. They each carry a Lynx
helicopter, primarily for SAR and one is almost continually patrolling
in the area of the North Cape.
