**Norwegian Navy**: Norway‘s Navy is small but built specifically to operate within the confined and turbulent waters of the North Sea along its rocky and mountainous coastline.\n\n**Frigates**: The Oslo Class are small Frigates but have recently been modernized (late 80‘s) and are capable of a wide range of general duties.\n\nPennant\n\nClass\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nF 300\n\nOslo\n\nOslo\n\nActive\n\nCentral Port\n\nF 301\n\nBergen\n\nActive\n\nNorth Patrol\n\nF 302\n\nTrondheim\n\nActive\n\nCentral Port\n\nF 303\n\nStevanger\n\nActive\n\nNorth Patrol\n\nF 304\n\nNarvik\n\nActive\n\nSouth Maint\n\n![](images/norway navy/Oslo-768x576.jpg)\n\nOslo Class\n\n \n\n**Corvettes**: Dating from the same era as the Oslo class but with the exception of an improved sonar installed in the late 80‘s, the two Sleipner class Corvettes are largely obsolete and used as training ships.\n\nPennant\n\nClass\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nF 310\n\nSleipner\n\nSleipner\n\nActive\n\nSouth Training\n\nF 311\n\nAeger\n\nActive\n\nSouth Training\n\n![](images/norway navy/Sleipner-768x514.jpg)\n\nHNoMS Sleipner\n\n \n\n**Fast Attack Craft**: The most numerous type of ship in the Norwegian navy.

All six boats were commissioned between 1989 and 1992 and therefore represent some of the most modern submarines available at the start of Northern Fury.

The one class of larger ships is the Nordkapp class.\n\n![](images/norway navy/image003.jpg) **[Nordkapp Class](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nordkapp-class_offshore_patrol_vessel)**: These three Outer Coast Guard Ships, otherwise called Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV) are 3300 tones, the size of a Frigate, but have fewer weapons or sensors. Their hulls are strengthened to withstand limited ice crushing, or ice browsing. Although it only carries a 57mm gun and machine guns, it can be fitted with Depth Charges, Penguin anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, 20mm guns and Mistral SAMs in wartime. The peacetime crew is 52 plus 6 for the air detachment, its wartime establishment is 76 and it has bunk space for 109. They each carry a Lynx helicopter, primarily for SAR.\n\nPennant\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nW320\n\nNordkapp\n\nActive\n\nNorth Cape\n\nPatrol\n\nW321\n\nSenja\n\nActive\n\nOslo\n\nTied up\n\nW322\n\nAndenes\n\nActive\n\nNorth Sea\n\nPatrol
