**Norwegian Air Force**

The Norwegian Air Force manages all air activity for the Army, Navy, and
Coast Guard as well as conducting traditional Air Force tasks. The
Primary fighter aircraft is the F-16. Although not part of the Norwegian
Air force, a flight of 2 or 3 NATO E-3A AWACS are semi-permanently
stationed an on task at Orland.

**F-16 Falcon**

Norway is one of the four European countries that invested heavily into
the F-16 Falcon project, purchasing 60 single seat ‘A’ models and 12
dual seat ‘B’ versions. Each of the four Squadrons conduct patrols in
North Norway on a rotational bases and regularly deploy to dispersal
bases throughout the country. A unique feature of Norwegian F-16s is the
ability to fire the AGM-119 ‘Penguin 3’ missile, an anti-ship armament
critical due to the long and vulnerable coastline. Historically the
first MLU (Mid life Upgrade) aircraft, able to fire the Aim-120 Air to
Air missile arrived in 1995; however, that has been advanced by a year
in Northern Fury and 338 Squadron has four of the improved aircraft on
its roster. The 12 ‘B’ model aircraft are concentrated at Regge but
routinely deploy to the operational squadrons.

At the start of Northern Fury, 331 Sqn from Bodo is forward based at
Bardufoss with 4 additional ‘B’ model aircraft, elements of 4-6 aircraft
are dispersed to Banak, Tromso and Evenes and they are maintaining a
24/7 Combat Air Patrol(CAP).

| 331 | Lion  | Bodo     | 16+4 | F-16A | \+4 F-16B |

**F-5 Tiger II**

Although Norway was in the process of retiring the F-5 Freedom Fighter,
increased tensions changed that plan. Historically by 1994 the only F-5s
remaining were 718 Sqn at the Fighter training school (14x F5B), 717
Reconnaissance Sqn (16x RF-5A) and 336 Sqn with 24x F-5A focusing on
ground attack. In Northern Fury however, two further squadrons were
activated in 1992. Although dated these aircraft were available and
airworthy so were used to fill a gap.

| Sqn | Name      | Location   | No. | Type          | Remarks  |
| --- | --------- | ---------- | --- | ------------- | -------- |
| 336 | Tigers    | Rygge      | 24  | F-5 Tiger II  |          |
| 339 | Jager     | Orland     | 24  | F-5 Tiger II  |          |
| 340 | Fox       | Gardermoen | 24  | F-5 Tiger II  |          |
| 717 | Raven     | Rygge      | 16  | RF-5 Tiger II | Recon    |
| 718 | Night Owl | Sola       | 14  | F-5B Tiger II | Training |

**Falcon 20**

Also under the control of 717 Sqn at Regge were two Falcon 20 Electronic
Warfare (EW) aircraft. These were civilian pattern Dassaut Falcon
executive jets that were heavily modified and sold to several air forces
as a stop-gap area EW platform. The programme was quite successful.

**P-3C & P-3N Orion**

These Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) were operated by No. 333 ‘Hawks’
Sqn out of Andoya. The four P-3C’s were standard Anti-Submarine Warfare
(ASW) versions while the two P-3N were modified to operate for the Coast
Guard and were unable to carry weapons, did not have a Magnetic Anomaly
Detector or Sonobuoys and was only able to conduct area surveillance and
other non-military missions.
