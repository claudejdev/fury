One of the original 12 nations that formed NATO in 1952, strategically
Belgium sits at a critical crossroads in Europe. The plains of Wallonia
and the forests of the Ardennes have been the main access of advance
both westward and then eastward in both World Wars. Based on this
Belgium is firmly ensconced in the idea of collective defence, and of
maintaining Germany as a NATO partner.

Belgiumâ€™s armed forces are completely integrated in the NATO command
structure. Indeed, **NATO HQ** in Brussels and **SHAPE** (Supreme
Headquarters Allied Powers Europe) near Mons hosts the leadership of all
allied nations.
