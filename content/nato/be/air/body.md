**Belgian Air Force**

Belgium maintained a powerful Air Force in the later Cold War era;
however, they were quick to try and cash in on the ‘Peace Dividend’ when
the Berlin Wall fell and most thought that the Cold war was ending.
Luckily, the coup in Moscow reversed the trend in Brussels and although
several squadrons were on the verge of standing down, they were kept,
initially at a lower state of readiness but as tension with a resurgent
Soviet Union heightened in 91/92, training increased and new weapons
were purchased. The Belgian Air Force was committed to **2<sup>nd</sup>
Allied Tactical Air Force (2 ATAF)** on the Central front over Germany.

**F-16**

Belgium and the Netherlands formed a production consortium to build
F-16s in Europe, eventually producing over 500 primarily for Norway,
Denmark and themselves. By 1991 the second major purchase order had been
completed with a total of 136 ‘A’ models and 24 ‘B’ models. The earlier
production examples were rebuilt to the Block 10 standard, bringing the
entire fleet to the Block 10/15 standard by 1992, with the final 40
being at the improved ‘OCU’ (Operational Capability Upgrade) standard.

Historically, Belgium obtained 72 Aim-120 AMRAAM and 12 AGM-65 missiles
in 1995. Northern Fury has them acquiring these munitions in 1993, and
the quantities increased to 140 AMRAAM and 36 Mavericks.
