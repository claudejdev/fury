**Belgium Navy**

The Belgian Navy is the smallest service in the country by far, with
only about 4,500 regular members and an equal number of reservists.
Unlike their Dutch, French and British neighbors, the Belgian Naval
Force (the official name until 2002) does not have a centuries old
tradition of exploring the globe; but has a much shorter and humbler
history. Within NATO they focus on keeping the English Channel and key
ports of North West Europe clear of mines.

**Frigates**

The four Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW) Frigates of the
[<span class="underline">Wielingen
class</span>](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Belgian-Navy/Frigate/Wielingen-class.htm)
are quite modest in size and armament. At 2,200 tons with a single 100mm
gun, a single Sea Sparrow air defence missile launcher (eight missiles),
four Exocet anti ship missiles and ASW weapons, these ships have limited
employability in a high threat area. All are base at Zeebrugge. F 913
Ran aground in 1988 while on an exercise in Norway, as a result she was
repaired in dry dock and deployed again in 1992, but was the first to
suffer from the ‘Peace Dividend’ and was decommissioned sometime between
1993 and 1995 (references vary). She is still on active duty in Northern
Fury.

**Mine Warfare Ships**

![M915foto.jpg](/assets/images/nato/be/navy/image2.jpeg)

**Tripartite Class** was a joint venture between Belgium, France and the
Netherlands to build an affordable, robust and interoperable costal mine
hunting ship using modern technology and methods. Belgium purchased 10
of these versatile little ships and bases them at Ostend. Each operates
two [<span class="underline">PAP

Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) which hunt for mines and can either cut
their cable or blow them up in place.

**Aggressive (or Agile) Class** is a much more traditional Ocean
Minesweeper but with added high frequency sonar to allow it to hunt
mines as well. They may be able to hunt and find mines but must still
rely on World War One era sweeping gear to destroy the mines. They have
wooden hulls and are constructed of non-magnetic materials. Built by the
US in the 50’s, four of the original six vessels survive and there were
two more acquired from Norway in 1966. They are based at Zeebrugge.

also date from the 50’s. Built in Belgium with American machinery, the
three remaining examples of this class, originally 18 strong, are
nearing the end of their useful life. Several others remain in service
after conversion to other purposes. [<span class="underline">All
