The Belgian Navy is the smallest service in the country by far, with only about 4,500 regular members and an equal number of reservists. Unlike their Dutch, French and British neighbors, the Belgian Naval Force (the official name until 2002) does not have a centuries old tradition of exploring the globe, but has a much shorter and humbler history. Within NATO they focus on keeping the English Channel and key ports of North West Europe clear of mines.

At 2,200 tons with a 100mm gun, a single Sea Sparrow air defence missile launcher and eight missiles, four Exocet anti ship missiles and ASW weapons, these ships are limited in their employability in a high threat area. All are base at Zeebrugge. F 913 Ran aground in 1988 while on an exercise in Norway, as a result she was repaired in dry dock and deployed again in 1992, but was the first to suffer from the ‘Peace Dividend‘ and was decommissioned sometime between 1993 and 1995 (references vary). She is still on active duty in Northern Fury.

**Mine Warfare Ships**

![](/assets/images/legacy/belgium navy/belgianNavy2.jpg) **Tripartite Class**: was a joint venture between Belgium, France and the Netherlands to build an affordable, robust and interoperable costal mine hunting ship using modern technology and methods. Belgium purchased 10 of these versatile little ships and bases them at Ostend. Each operates two PAP 104 Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) which hunt for mines and can either cut them or blow them up in place.

The must rely on World War One era sweeping gear to destroy the mines however. They have wooden hulls and are constructed of non-magnetic materials. Built by the US in the 50‘s, four of the original six vessels survive and there were two more acquired from Norway in 1966. They are based at Zeebrugge.
