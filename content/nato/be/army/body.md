**Belgian Arm**y

The Belgian army fields a Corps sized force with five active Brigades,
four within the Corps and the Para-Commando Brigade. The Corps HQ,
16<sup>th</sup> Division, portions of 1<sup>st</sup> Division and many
of the Corps Troops are located in Germany in the Soest Area; 250Km East
of the Belgian border. Up to 40,000 of the 68,000 regular soldiers in
the Belgian Army were stationed in Germany. The Para Commando Bde is
assigned to the AMF (ACE \[Allied Command Europe\] Mobile Force) and was
expected to deploy to North Norway in an emergency.

**AIFV-B**

The Belgian Army’s main Infantry Combat Vehicle is the AIFV-B. This is a
development of the ubiquitous M-113 but improved to provide infantry
with heavy fire power, a Halon fire suppression systems and better
suspension. 514 AIFV-B’s were purchased in addition to 525 M113A-B.
About half of the AIFV-B’s were equipped with the 25mm gun, while most
of the remainder had a .50 Calibre Heavy Machine Gun. Many of the M113’s
were the 81mm Mortar or Milan ATGM variants. These vehicles were
delivered in the late 80’s to replace the AMX-VCI family of APCs, up to
500 of which were still available in 1994.
