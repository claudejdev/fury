**Netherlands Navy**

The Royal Netherlands Navy dates back to the 16<sup>th</sup> century
where it was one of the most powerful in the world, maintaining its
skill by fighting against most of its European neighbours. Today it’s a
much more modest force but carries on long standing traditions of duty
and seamanship. Based largely on Frigates this very capable navy has
some excellent ships.

[**Tromp
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Netherlands-Navy/Frigate/Tromp-class.htm)

Built to be Task Group (TG) Flagships, these two area air defence ships
would be classed as Destroyers in most other navies. At 4000 tons and
carrying both long range ‘Standard’ and short range ‘Sea Sparrow’
Surface to Air Missiles (SAM) for air defence, these ships could
simultaneously protect the TG and themselves. Commissioned in 1975 & 76
they are approaching their mid life point in Northern Fury.

[**Karel Doorman
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Netherlands-Navy/Frigate/Karel-Doorman-class.htm)

These multi-purpose ships are emerging from the building yards as war
starts. The lead ship in the class was commissioned in 1991, while the
6<sup>th</sup> ship was rushed into service in December of 1993, the
7<sup>th</sup> is fitting out and should be commissioned in several
months, leaving only the last ship in the class on the sidelines.
Although not overly capable in any one role, these ships provide very
effective and modern sensors to a TG and, like most Frigates, make an
excellent life support system for an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW)
helicopter, in this case the Westland
Lynx.

[**Kortenaer
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Netherlands-Navy/Frigate/Kortenaer-Standard-class.htm)

This class of 10 ships were similar to the German *Bremen* class and
focused primarily an ASW patrol and escort duties. Slightly larger than
the Karel Doorman these ships carried two helicopters, but otherwise had
a similar armament but older
sensors.

[**Jacob van Heemskerck
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Netherlands-Navy/Frigate/Jacob-van-Heemskerck-class.htm)

These two ships were based on the Kortenaer class, modified to replace
the ASW helicopters with the same AD capabilities as the Tromp class
with 40 ‘Standard’ medium range SAMs and 24 ‘Sea Sparrow’ point defence
SAMs. The lack of helicopters meant that these ships needed to pair up
with a Kortenaer class to have ASW protection, but they could perform
the role of an AD Destroyer from the hull of a
Frigate.

[**Alkmaar class
Minehunter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite-class_minehunter)

This is the Dutch version of the Tripartite class. Conceived and built
together with the French and Belgians this class of ship is the modern
mainstay of NATO’s mine hunting force. The Netherlands has 15 of these
vessels. NATO has three ‘Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Groups’
(SNMCMG): SNMCMG-1 normally remains in northern Europe and is stationed
in the English Channel. SNMCMG-2 is in the Mediterranean and is usually
operating in the Adriatic off of Croatia. Finally, SNMCMG-3 (only in the
Northern Fury world) is stationed in Djibouti and patrols the entrance
to the Red Sea.

**AOR (Fast Replenishment Ships)**

In 1994 the Dutch Navy had two replenishment ships. HNLMS Poolster was
about to go out of service later in 1994 and HNLMS Zuidekruis which was
based on the Poolster’s design but was 10 years newer. These two ships
provided underway replenishment for the remainder of the navy and other
NATO navies as
well.

**Submarines**

Due to increased tensions, the last of the Walrus class boats was
accelerated into service, being commissioned in Jan instead of July of
1994. All other classes were retired including the two Zwaardvis class
boats which were decommissioned early.

[**Walrus
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Netherlands-Navy/Submarine/Walrus-class.htm)

These four boats are excellent blue water SSKs and are extremely quiet
due to an advanced tail configuration. These boats are fast, quiet and
deadly.

**Maritime Aviation**

**P-3C Orion**

The Royal Netherlands Navy operates two P-3C Maritime Patrol Aircraft
(MPA) squadrons, a total of 13 were acquired. Both 320 and 321 Squadrons
operate out of Valkenburg. Although each Sqn operates six aircraft,
there are two permanently located at Curacao in the Caribbean and two
more permanently located an NAS Sigonella in the Mediterranean.

**Lynx**

Three different versions of this helicopter are employed: Six Mk.25
(SH-14A) are used for utility and SAR missions, three have been upgraded
to the (SH-14B) model. For shipborne ASW work, 18 Mk.27, upgraded to the
Mk.81/SH-14C standard with a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) are used.
The SH-14C are capable of carrying out the SAR task as well.
