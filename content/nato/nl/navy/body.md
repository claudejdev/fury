The Royal Netherlands Navy dates back to the 16th century where it was one of the most powerful navies in the world, fighting against most of its European neighbours. Today it is a much more modest force but carries on long standing traditions of duty and seamanship. Based largely on Frigates this very capable navy has some excellent ships.\n\n![](images/netherlands navy/image001.jpg) **[Tromp Class](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Netherlands-Navy/Frigate/Tromp-class.htm)**: Built to be Task Group (TG) Flagships, these two area air defence ships would be classed as Destroyers in most other navies. At 4000 tons and carrying both long range ‘Standard‘ Surface to Air Missiles (SAM) for air defence and short range ‘Sea Sparrow‘, these ships could simultaneously protect the TG and themselves. Commissioned in 1975 & 76 they are approaching their mid life point in Northern Fury.\n\nPennant\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nF801\n\nTromp\n\nDry Dock\n\nAmsterdam\n\nHigh Readiness\n\nF806\n\nDe Ruyter\n\nActive\n\nNorth Sea\n\n![](images/netherlands navy/image002.jpg) **[Karel Doorman Class](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Netherlands-Navy/Frigate/Karel-Doorman-class.htm)**: These multi-purpose ships are emerging from the building yards as war starts. The lead ship in the Class was commissioned in 1991, while the 6th ship was rushed into commission in December of 1993, the 7th is fitting out and should be commissioned in several months, leaving only the last ship in the class on the sidelines. Although not overly capable in any one role, these ships provide very capable and modern sensors to a TG and, like most Frigates, make an excellent life support system for an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopter, in this case the Westland Lynx.\n\nPennant\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nF827\n\n[Karel Doorman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_frigate_Leopold_I_(F930)>)\n\nActive\n\nBaltic\n\nPatrol\n\nF829\n\n[Willem van der Zaan](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_frigate_Louise-Marie_(F931)>)\n\nActive\n\nMediterranean\n\nCruise\n\nF830\n\n[Tjerk Hiddes](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Tjerk_Hiddes_(F830)>)\n\nActive\n\nNorth Sea\n\nTraining\n\nF831\n\n[Van Amstel](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Van_Amstel_(F831)>)\n\nActive\n\nNorth Sea\n\nPort Call London\n\nF832\n\n[Abraham van der Hulst](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Abraham_Van_Der_Hulst_(F832)>)\n\nActive\n\nRotterdam\n\nMaintenance\n\nF833\n\n[Van Nes](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Van_Nes_(F833)>)\n\nActive\n\nNorth Sea\n\nSTANAVFORLANT\n\nF834\n\n[Van Galen](<https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HNLMS_Van_Galen_(F834)&action=edit&redlink=1>)\n\nFitting out\n\nAmsterdam\n\nF828\n\n[Van Speijk](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Van_Speijk_(F828)>)\n\nBuilding\n\nAmsterdam\n\n![](images/netherlands navy/image003.jpg) **[Kortenaer Class](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Netherlands-Navy/Frigate/Kortenaer-Standard-class.htm)**: This class of 10 ships were very similar to the German Bremen class and were primarily an ASW patrol and escort ship.

Conceived and built together with the French and Belgians this class of ship is the modern mainstay of NATO‘s mine hunting force. The Netherlands has 15 of these vessels. NATO has three ‘Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Groups‘ (SNMCMG): SNMCMG-1 normally remains in northern Europe and is stationed in the English Channel. SNMCMG-2 is in the Mediterranean and is usually operating in the Adriatic off of Croatia. Finally, SNMCMG-3 (only in the Northern Fury world) is stationed in Djibouti and patrols the entrance to the Red Sea.\n\nPennant\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nM850\n\nAlkmaar\n\nActive\n\nDen Helder\n\nTied up\n\nM851\n\nDelfzijl\n\nActive\n\nDen Helder\n\nTied up\n\nM852\n\nDordrecht\n\nActive\n\nOstend\n\nSNMCMG1\n\nM853\n\nHaarlem\n\nActive\n\nDen Helder\n\nTied up\n\nM854\n\nHarlingen\n\nActive\n\nDen Helder\n\nTied up\n\nM855\n\nScheveningen\n\nActive\n\nOstend\n\nSNMCMG1\n\nM856\n\nMaasluis\n\nActive\n\nDen Helder\n\nTied up\n\nM857\n\nMakkum\n\nActive\n\nDen Helder\n\nTied up\n\nM858\n\nMiddelburg\n\nActive\n\nOstend\n\nSNMCMG1\n\nM859\n\nHellevoetsluis\n\nActive\n\nOstend\n\nSNMCMG1\n\nM860\n\nSchiedam\n\nActive\n\nDen Helder\n\nTied up\n\nM861\n\nUrk\n\nActive\n\nDen Helder\n\nTied up\n\nM862\n\nZierikzee\n\nActive\n\nMediterranean\n\nSNMCMG2\n\nM863\n\nVlaardingen\n\nActive\n\nMediterranean\n\nSNMCMG2\n\nM864\n\nWillemstad\n\nActive\n\nMediterranean\n\nSNMCMG3\n\n**AOR (Fast Replenishment Ships)**: In 1994 the Dutch Navy had two replenishment ships. HNLMS Poolster was about to go out of service later in 1994 and HNLMS Zuidekruis which was based on the Poolster‘s design but was 10 years newer. These two ships provided underway replenishment for the remainder of the navy and other NATO navies as well.\n\nPennant\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nA835\n\n[Poolster](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Poolster_(A835)>)\n\nActive\n\nDen Helder\n\nTied up\n\nA832\n\n[Zuiderkruis](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Zuiderkruis_(A832)>)\n\nActive\n\nDen Helder\n\nTied up\n\n![](images/netherlands navy/image006.jpg) **Submarines**: Due to increased tensions, the last of the Walrus class boats was accelerated into service, being commissioned in Jan instead of July of 1994. All other classes were retired including the two Zwaardvis class boats which were decommissioned early.\n\n![](images/netherlands navy/image007.jpg) **Walrus Class**: These four boats are excellent blue water SSKs which are extremely quiet due to an advanced tail configuration.

Both 320 and 321 Squadrons operated out of Valkenburg. Although each Sqn operates six aircraft, there are two permanently located at Curacao in the Caribbean and two more permanently located an NAS Sigonella in the Mediterranean.\n\n![](images/netherlands navy/image009.jpg) **Lynx**: Three different versions of this helicopter were used: The Mk.25 (SH-14A) was used for utility and SAR missions, six were used and they are being upgraded to the (SH-14B) model. The 18 Mk.27 initially received had basic ASW capability and have been upgraded to the Mk.81/SH-14C standard by adding a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD). The SH-14C are capable of carrying out the SAR task as well.
