One of the twelve original members of NATO, The Netherlands are both a
continental and a maritime power. In addition to their commitments to
Europe, they have legacy colonies that both rely on the mother country
for protection and draw and provide resources. The Dutch are a critical
element in the Land, Sea and Air defences of Europe.
