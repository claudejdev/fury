One of the twelve original members of NATO, The Netherlands are both a
continental and a maritime power. In addition to their commitments to
Europe, they have legacy colonies that rely on the mother country for
protection. The Dutch are a critical element in the Land, Sea and Air
defences of Europe and have a relatively large force to aid in
collective defence.
