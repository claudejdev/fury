**Royal Air Force (RAF)**

The RAF operated four major based in Germany while maintaining the bulk
of its force in the UK and servicing various global commitments. A
divers but somewhat dated force with improved versions of older aircraft
filling front line roles to shore up gaps. The newest Tornados, being
only 10-12 years old were the most modern major platform available.

Known as the IDS (Inter**d**ictor/Strike) in Europe and GR1 (Ground
Attack/Reconnaissance) in the UK, this highly capable low level swept
wing strike fighter was designed specifically to penetrate Soviet and
Warsaw Pact defenses at high speed to deliver conventional or nuclear
ordnance. The GR.1 used sophisticated aircraft navigation rather than
precision bomb guidance to achieve its mission. The design, shared by
West Germany and Italy, and adopted by Saudi Arabia was highly
successful with around 750 produced in total, the RAF receiving 230
examples. Unlike most air forces, with the notable exception of the
USAF, the RAF kept a significant war reserve and in 1994 there were 82
GR.1’s available in storage to reinforce the front line squadrons. The
RAF maintained seven Squadrons on two German bases (Bruggen and
Laarbruch), and five squadrons in the UK at Marham and Lossimouth, with
the two squadrons at Lossimouth equipped with a modified GR1B able to
use the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile. The Operational Conversion Unit
(OCU) is also at Lossiemouth. Historically almost half of these
squadrons disbanded between 1991 and 1995, they remain extant in the
Northern Fury world however.

Another major variant of the Tornado is the F.3 (Fighter, Mark 3). Known
as the ADV (Air Defence Variant) in Europe this is a specialized
interceptor to counter Soviet bombers. The F.3 shares many components
with the GR1 (80%), it has a longer range, better radar and faster
acceleration. It should be noted that the F.3 is not an agile ‘Dog
Fighter’ such as the F-15, it’s meant to intercept, destroy and retire.
The nine squadrons are all located in the UK on three bases. The RAF has
39 F.3’s in reserve as well as 18 F.2’s which were an interim
predecessor to the F.3 with less power and older avionics.

The Harrier GR.7 was designed for ground attack missions conducted from
dispersed airfields in a very high threat environment. Although similar
to the USMC AV-8B, there were many differences such as the defensive
suite, gun and a host of other minor variations. The GR.7 was an
improved second generation Harrier able to operate at night and all
weather. Production amounted to 34 newly built GR.7’s and 54 converted
GR.5’s for a total of 88. Of these 24 were in storage and 64 in four
squadrons, two in Germany and two, including the OCU in the UK.

<img src="/assets\images\nato\uk\air\image4.jpg" style="width:5.61875in;height:2.72917in" />

During the 70’s & 80’s the RAF went through some difficult times, with
second generation aircraft such as the Lightning, Hunter and Canberra
coming to the end of their life and new aircraft such as the Tornado a
long way off. To partially fill the gap various options were considered,
one was to build modified American F-4 Phantoms. With Rolls-Royce
engines, some structural changes and the ability to use a reconnaissance
and FLIR pod, 118 of the FGR.2’s entered service first in the strike
role but as the Tornado GR.1’s came on line they also moved to the
interceptor role. As the Tornado F.3 came into service, the FGR.2 was
supposed to retire but in Northern Fury they were retained past their
1992 withdrawal date. Over the years, 37 of the original airframes were
written off leaving enough to equip four operational squadrons, a large
OCU and holde 9 in reserve.

Another 3<sup>rd</sup> generation fighter surviving in the RAF was the
SEPECAT Jaguar. Due to be retied in the early 90’s, this nimble
workhorse proved itself an excellent low level precision attack platform
during the Gulf war. Instead of being retired, 50 of them were upgraded
to the GR3 standard which improved targeting and navigation equipment as
well as other enhancements. Northern Fury accelerates this upgrade by
about a year. The three remaining Jaguar squadrons are all based at
Coltishall in the UK.

Yet another venerable aircraft in the RAF was the Blackburn Buccaneer.
The ‘Buc’ first flew for the Royal Navy (RN) in 1958, and entered RAF
service in 1969. Due for retirement along with the Jaguar, the Gulf War
showed that there was still a useful role for these old birds. With 206
Buccaneers built, and at its peak, about 90 serving in the RAF deployed
to five squadrons, by 1994 there were only about 45 left airworthy with
32 of them flying in two squadrons at Lossimouth. The final role for
these versatile low level penetrators was Maritime Attack with the Sea
Eagle anti-ship missile.

<img src="/assets\images\nato\uk\air\image7.jpeg" style="width:4.66667in;height:2.5025in" />

The RAF’s primary Jet training aircraft is the BAE T.1 Hawk. This highly
successful aircraft is used around the world for the training role as
well as some variants for light attack and air defence. Of the 176 in
use with RAF, 88 have been converted to the T.1A version, to fulfill a
secondary Air Defence function with the fitting of two AIM-9L Sidewinder
missiles. These are meant purely for UK airspace and not intended for
deployment.

RAF No.8 Squadron operates six E-3D Sentry AWACS at RAF Waddinton, the
primary responsibility is UK airspace but they routinely deploy to other
locations to back up NATO, French and US aircraft. Historically these
were operated by both No.8 and No.23 Sqns, but in Northern Fury No.23
Sqn retains its Tornados so all AWACS are operated by one Sqn.

[**Canberra PR

<img src="/assets\images\nato\uk\air\image9.jpg" style="width:5.34375in;height:3.81523in" />

Over 900 Canberra’s were produced in the UK during the 1950’s, the last
23 of them built were the English Electric Canberra PR Mk.9. Entering
service with the RAF in 1958 these Photo Reconnaissance specialists were
still serving in 1994, and indeed only retired in 2006 after 55 years!
Based at Marham, No.12 Squadron RAF ‘Harry’s Mob’ operates 12 of them.
The outstanding feature of this aircraft is its ability to operate at
50,000 feet, certainly rivaled by the USAF ‘U-2’ and ‘SR-71’ but not
many other airframes could operate at that altitude.

[**Nimrod MR.2**](http://www.armedforces.co.uk/raf/listings/l0010.html)

<img src="/assets\images\nato\uk\air\image10.jpg" style="width:4.85417in;height:3.2214in" />

The Nimrod MR.2 was the primary Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) used to
conduct Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), mostly in the North Sea, the
approaches to the English Channel and between Scotland and Iceland. The
RAF originally received 47 aircraft in 1969. In 1979, 35 of these were
upgraded to MR.2 which included extensive modernization, a new radar, a
new acoustic processor and many other features. Over time, additional
capabilities such as in flight refueling and the carrying of external
defensive weapons were added. Five squadrons operate the MR.2, including
42 Sqn which was not disbanded in 1992 due to the increased threat in
Northern Fury.

Three of the original Nimrods were adapted to collect signals
intelligence and track electronic signatures. If the MR.2 is similar to
the American P-3C Orion, the R.1 is equivalent of the EP-3e ARIES II.
All three aircraft are operated by No.51 Sqn at RAF Waddington. The most
distinctive feature is the lack of a MAD (Magnetic Anomaly Detector)
Boom extending from the tail of the aircraft.

**Transport and Tanker Fleet**

[**VC-10 (C1K, K2, K3,
K4)**](http://www.armedforces.co.uk/raf/listings/l0046.html)

These converted Vickers VC-10 airliners came from a variety of sources
and were converted into Air-to-Air refuelling tankers from the late ‘70s
to the early ‘90s. There were differences but all had essentially the
same capability, to move freight and conduct mid-air refuelling of RAF
and allied aircraft. There were 13x C1K, 5x K2, 4x K3, and 5x K4,
totaling 27; all operated by No.10 and No.101 Sqn out of Brize Norton.

<img src="/assets\images\nato\uk\air\image13.jpg" style="width:4.16667in;height:3.33536in" />

Another air refuelling aircraft with the RAF was the Lockheed TriStar.
Nine were purchased in 1984 after the Falklands war highlighted the need
for this type of capability. All nine were operated from Brize Norton by
No.216 ‘Two N Six’ Sqn. Two of the nine were dedicated tankers (K1)
which could carry some cargo and passengers, three were dedicated to
cargo only (C2), and the other four could be used for either role (KC1).

This tactical transport is the workhorse of most western air forces; the
RAF is no different. Of the 66 C-130E’s purchased and designated the
Hercules K C1, about half (31) were converted into a stretched model
(C3) adding 37% to the cargo space. Both versions have had a refueling
probe added. Five Sqns operate the Hercules out of RAF Lynham.
