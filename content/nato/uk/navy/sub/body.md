**Royal Navy (RN) Submarines**

**SSBN**

Since the mid-1960s, Britain maintained a fleet of nuclear powered
Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN) as a key element of her nuclear
deterrent policy. Missiles were procured from the United States and it
is assumed – there is always a high degree of secrecy regarding SSBNs –
that their patrols were coordinated with the US Navy (USN). The only
other NATO country with a submarine launched Ballistic Missile
capability was France with their conventionally powered Redoubtable
class SSBs, it is unlikely that the French patrols were coordinated with
either the RN or the USN due to France’s severance from the NATO
integrated military command.

The RN maintained a fleet of four SSBNs all based in Scotland near
Glasgow; in 1994 the first of the new Vanguard class was in service and
*HMS Revenge* had been retired, oddly *Revenge* was the newest of the
Resolution class but was first to retire. With a fleet of four boats and
an assumption that one would be in extended refit at any time thus
leaving three to conduct patrols. Therefore, a reasonable deduction is
that one boat was on patrol at all times, one in port at all times
replenishing and routine maintenance, and the third would probably be on
patrol or ready to go on patrol quickly. This
[link](http://triservice.blogspot.ca/2011/06/royal-navy-submarine-life.html)
indicates that the average patrol length was three months, and that
there were two crews for each boat, so the boat could be at sea for up
to nine months a year with a month in port between each patrol.

We don’t know where the patrol areas are but if one deduces the targets
and the range of the missiles, and takes a good look at the hiding spots
in the sea, a rough area can be plotted. There must be some solid logic
to the chosen areas because in 2009 two SSNBs, one French and one
British
[collided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Vanguard_and_Le_Triomphant_submarine_collision).
This incident tells us at least three things: 1) These boats are very
quiet and hard to detect, even by each other; 2) The RN and the French
Navy do not coordinate their patrol areas; and 3) The ideal area for a
patrol was deduced by two navies independent of each other so it is
probably predictable.

[**Vanguard
Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/vanguard_class.htm)

*HMS Vanguard*, S-28 is the first of her class and a quantum leap
forward in technology to her predecessors. At 16000 tons, she displaces
almost as much as an Invincible Class aircraft carrier, and is wider,
deeper and 75% the length of that ship. With the advanced systems on
board she has a crew of only 135. Northern Fury starts with this boat on
patrol. *HMS Victorious*, second in the class has been launched but is
11 months from commissioning, even if rushed she would take at least six
months to be ready.

The *Vanguard* carries 12 Trident II SLBM (Submarine Launched Ballistic
Missiles), with up to 12 MIRVs (Multiple independently targetable
re-entry vehicles). Under an agreement with the US, the UK designs and
manufactures its own MIRVs, and these appear to be of varying nuclear
yields. The range with a full load is \~4,200 nautical miles, or up to
\~7,500 nautical miles with a reduced load, the exact ranges are
classified.

*HMS Vanguard*

[**Resolution
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Royal-Navy/Submarine/Resolution-class.htm)

The three remaining boats in this class were all commissioned in 1967 or
1968, they are much smaller than the Vanguard class and with systems
that were cutting edge when launched, but dated by 1994. In the mid ‘80s
they were upgraded to Polaris A3TK SLBM with the Chevaline MIRV system.
Each sub carried 16 Polaris missiles each with three MIRVs.

Resolution Class

**Fleet Submarines (SSN)**

These are the famous ‘Hunter-Killer’ subs, the work horses of the
submarine fleet. The RN has 13 front line SSNs of the Trafalgar and
Swiftsure classes and due to an updated threat assessment, has
maintained five older boats of the Churchill and Valiant class beyond
their forecasted retirement. Each of the older boats required a dry dock
period of over a year and it’s estimated that this will add a decade to
their service life, the last of them is still in dry-dock. Of the 18
boats, the RN keeps 12 at sea for 4-6 week patrols. Two are usually in
the South Atlantic, two in the Mediterranean, two split between the
Indian Ocean or Pacific, and six in the North Atlantic. All RN
submarines have strengthened fins and retractable hydroplanes allowing
them to surface through arctic ice.

Britain’s Fleet Submarines of the ‘80s and early ‘90s were plagued by
the extremely unreliable Tigerfish torpedo. Early examples of this
torpedo – Mod 0 experienced over a 60% failure rate. During the
Falklands war, the Argentinian Ship General Belgrano was sunk using WW2
era unguided torpedoes instead of risking the use of a Tigerfish. By the
mid ‘80s, the Mod 2 corrected many of the faults but it was still
erratic – and worse, the submarine crews did not trust it. Cruise
missiles were adopted in RN submarines for attacking surface targets
because the Tigerfish was so unreliable! An urgent call for replacement
resulted in the Spearfish torpedo, a much improved design entering
service in 1992. Better guidance, faster computing and a 70 mile per
hour attack speed make the Spearfish a much better choice. By the start
of Northern Fury, most boats went on patrol with a mix of both types, a
situation that will continue until production of the Spearfish ramps up.

[**Trafalgar
Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/trafalgar_class.htm)

The most modern Fleet boats in the RN, this class of seven were based in
Plymouth. The newest, HMS Triumph was commissioned in late 1991. This
class is extremely quiet, has excellent sonars and other sensors and is
heavily armed with over 30 weapons, a mix of Tomahawk cruise missiles
and torpedoes.

*HMS Trafalgar*

[**Swiftsure
Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/swiftsure_class.htm)

The six boats of this class were considered 2<sup>nd</sup> Generation
SSNs with a much improved hull design, but fewer weapons and the same
sonar setup as the previous Valiant class. Historically Swiftsure
herself was retired early due to cracks being discovered in her reactor
while being refitted, in Northern Fury these were repaired and she was
brought back into service after six additional months in dry-dock.

*HMS Superb*

[**Churchill
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Royal-Navy/Submarine/Resolution-class.htm)

Often considered an Improved Valiant class with many minor
modifications. The three boats of this class served from the early ‘70’s
and were due for retirement after only 20 years at sea due to the end of
the Cold War. In Northern Fury, all three boats in this have undergone a
mid-life refit and are expected to serve for at least another decade.
HMS Conqueror gained international fame during the Falklands war by
sinking the Argentinian Cruiser General Belgrano.

[**Valiant
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Royal-Navy/Submarine/Valiant-class.htm)

The two boats of this class were the first fully British SSNs. The one
predecessor *HMS Dreadnought* had used an American reactor and was
retired in 1980. These two boats had a long and active career, achieving
many ‘firsts’ for the RN. They were 10 years older than the follow on
Churchill class so a life extension was much more contentious and
complicated, *HMS Warspite* is sill in dry-dock after a year of refit,
and it will likely be several more months before she is fit to sail
again. HMS Valiant, historically retired in August of 1994 and she may
still due so because of the problems *Warspite* is having, she is
scheduled to begin refitting in October 1994.

**Diesel Powered Submarines**

The RN operate two types of Diesel-electric submarines. There are
several advantages of these submarines over nuclear powered SSNs but the
main disadvantages are speed, and the need to recharge the batteries to
enable electric operation. Two key advantages are size, these boats are
much smaller and therefore more maneuverable in restricted waters, and
silence. Stealth in a submarine is fundamental to survivability and its
ability to stalk its pray, Diesel-electric boats are much quieter than
nuclear boats which must run cooling pumps to keep the reactors under
control. The traditional classification for a ‘conventionally’ powered
boat is ‘SS’, while many newer boats are classified as ‘SSK’, with the K
indicating ‘Hunter-Killer’. Although these boats could travel long
distances they spent most of their time patrolling in home waters, with
half of them either at sea or ready to deploy on short notice.

[**Upholder
Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/upholder_class.htm)

Commissioned between 1990 and 1993, these four boats are state of the
art when it comes to Diesel-electric submarines. They are ultra quiet,
relatively fast with a submerged speed of 20 Knts, have an 8,000
nautical mile range and six torpedo tubes, all with a displacement of
only 2500 tons and a crew of 50, less than half of an average SSN. The
RN planned to build 12 of these boats to replace the aging Oberon boats,
but the end of the Cold War saw the cancelation of these plans and the
sale of the four boats to Canada in 1998. In Northern Fury, the next
batch of four boats is now building with the third batch about to be
ordered.

Upholder Class

[**Oberon
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Royal-Navy/Submarine/Oberon-class.htm)

There were 27 of this highly successful class of boat built for five
navies, 13 for the RN between 1961 and 1963. Since 1986 however seven of
the older boats were retired leaving six on active duty, slightly longer
than the historic timeline. They are being replaced by the Upholder
class. When these boats were launched they were considered the best of
their type anywhere, and that distinction was maintained through
upgrades over time. Technology and age however, was getting the better
of them by the early 80’s and the replacement Upholders were ordered.
