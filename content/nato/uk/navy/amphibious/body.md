**Royal Navy Amphibious**

[**HMS Ocean (L12)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Ocean_(L12))

Historically this ship was proposed in 1992, ordered in 93, laid down in
94, launched in 95 and commissioned in 98. For Northern Fury however,
that timeline is advanced to where she will be commissioned in March of
1994. The three years of fitting out was reduced to two and she was
launched in March of 1992. This LPH (Landing Platform, Helicopter),
while only marginally larger than the Fearless Class, is substantially
more capable and modern. She carries four small landing craft (LCVPs)
and up to 18 helicopters in order to land the 830 Royal Marines that can
be embarked.

[**Fearless
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless-class_landing_platform_dock)

The core element of the Royal Navy’s amphibious capability resides with
the two Fearless Class LPDs (Landing Platform Docks). Both have had long
and busy careers with the highlight for both being the amphibious
operations to retake the Falkland Islands in 1982. HMS Fearless(L10)
underwent and extensive refit in the late ‘80s, recommissioning in 1991,
while historically HMS Intrepid(L11) was then decommissioned and did not
undergo this refit – in Northern Fury she does. Intrepid went to
dry-dock in early 1991 and emerged in Nov of 1993 where she was
structurally repaired as well as being fitted with 20 mm BMARC and
Phalanx CIWS guns, new communications suites and better accommodation.
Both ships are home ported at Portsmouth.

[**Round Table or Sir Lancelot
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Table-class_landing_ship_logistics)

These six LSL (Landing Ship Logistics) are operated by the Royal Fleet
Auxiliary (RFA) and are not strictly amphibious assault ships. They can
offload across a shore via their front loading ramp, but are not
designed for assaulting the beach. One of the six, RFA Sir Galahad was
sunk during the Falklands campaign and has been replaced by a newer and
slightly larger ship of the same name. They can transport 400 troops
comfortably and over 500 for short durations, additionally a mix of
vehicles including up to 12 Main Battle Tanks and/or over 100 land
rovers can be loaded. Instead of vehicles up to 46 cargo containers can
be loaded as required. Although they cannot support an embarked
helicopter, they have two landing decks, one for a Sea King size or
smaller aft, and another for a CH-47 or smaller amidships. They have
both a front and rear loading ramp.

[**LCU Mk.9**](http://www.navypedia.org/ships/uk/brit_aws_lcu9r.htm)

Landing Craft Utility (LCU) are the workhorses of the amphibious fleet.
Each of the LPDs carry four of these small craft in their well deck, and
in turn the LCUs carry either one tank, four large vehicles or 120 Royal
Marines ashore. 14 LCUs are in service, one from HMS Fearless was sunk
in and Argentinian Air attack during the Falklands war, and has not been
replaced. Four are on each of the LPDs, four more at Pool for training
and 2 are deployed on various tasks.

[**LCVP Mk5**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCVP_(United_Kingdom))

In addition to the LCUs, each LPD and HMS Ocean carry four LCVP (Landing
Craft, Vehicle & Personnel) on davits. Older RN LCVPs have been replaced
by the Mk5 which provides much more capability than the older models. An
entire Royal Marine company (140 troops) can be transported in four
LCVPs which can carry 38 troops each (including 3 crew) or a light
vehicle up to 210 nautical miles. In total 18 are in service with the
RN, plus four older Mk4s are used by the Army.

[**RHIB**](http://www.eliteukforces.info/uksf-gear/ribs/)

Most RN RHIBs (Ridged Hull Inflatable Boat) are of the 7 Meter variety,
they can carry 15 troops at more than 40 Knots speed. Generally, they
are unarmed. Dozens are in service, some with modifications and, because
the basic boat is available commercially, this can be expanded to
hundreds at very short notice.

[**RRC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_Raider)

The Ridged Raiding Craft (RRC) pre dates the RHIB by several decades but
accomplishes the same task. Available in two sizes, 6.5 and 8 meters,
these are widely used by both the RN and the Royal Marines for a variety
of tasks, but the main job is to carry a crew of 3 and 8 fully equipped
troops to the beach. Speed varies from 33 up to 50 knots depending on
load. Dozens of these boats are available at every RN Base and they can
be found in use on every ship.
