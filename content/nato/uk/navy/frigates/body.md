**Royal Navy Frigates**

The Royal Navy essentially developed Anti-Submarine Warfare during the
First and early years of the Second World War, and that is where they
remain strong.  In addition to building some of the best ASW platforms
in the world, the gathering threat from a resurgent Soviet Union
compelled the RN to save a number of older Frigates from the breakers
yard. Although this helped plug some gaps, the world wide commitments
are stretching the RN quite thin, and it’s their hard working Frigates
which are filling the pressure.

[**Leander Class – Type
12**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leander-class_frigate): This is the
most numerous and longest serving class of Frigates built by the British
in the post Second World war era.  Although very successful when new; by
1994 they were quite dated, and are only suitable for secondary roles.
Built in three batches the 26 ships of this class received various
mid-life upgrades to improve capability but historically all were
retired by the mid 90’s.  In Northern Fury, 17 of these ships remain on
active service from six different batches or modification sets. Over
time sensors and weapons changed considerably. Some key capabilities
noted in the table are:

-   Gun = Twin 4.5in guns

-   Ikara is a missile witch launches an ASW torpedo to a range of 10
    nautical miles and drops it into the sea, ideally directly above the
    target submarine.

-   SeaCat is an early short range SAM (4 miles) 24 or 32 missiles
    carried

-   SeaWolf is more modern short range SAM (4 miles) 24 missiles carried

-   Exocet = 4x Exocet ASMs carried

-   TA = Type 2031 Passive only Towed Array Sonar System (TASS)

-   Lynx = Lynx HAS.2 ASW helicopter

[**Type 21** **Amazon
class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_21_frigate): Seven of the
eight ships in this class deployed to the Falkland Islands campaign,
were they proved excellent at shore bombardment but not much else.  They
were poor Air Defense ships and quite loud and dated as ASW ships.  Two
were sunk in that campaign, ***F170 Antelope*** and ***F184 Ardent***. 
Historically the remaining six of this class were sold to Pakistan in
1993-94, this sale was canceled and the ships retained as general
purpose escorts.

[**Type 22** **Broadsword
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_22_frigate): This much
improved class consists of 14 ships in three batches.  Primarily ASW
platforms, these are capable general purpose ships. Batch 3 is
significantly improved due to the experience from the Falklands war, and
the four ships of this batch were commissioned to replace four ships of
other classes lost in that war.

[**Type 23 Duke Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_23_frigate):
These Frigates are very capable, well balanced ships capable of
operating independently or as a key ASW, AAW or ASuW ship within a Task
Force. They are one of the best ASW platforms in the world. Nine are
available in Northern Fury, three being accelerated into service and
commissioning 6-8 months earlier than they did historically. These ships
are a valuable addition to any NATO task force.
