***HMS Ark Royal* CVG**

*HMS Ark Royal (Noah's Ark)* commenced a patrol of Indian Ocean two
months ago, operating with Combined Task Force 150 (CTF 150) on counter
piracy and freedom of navigation duties. In Mid January, HMS Cardiff’s
attached Helicopter crashed on deck and was a total write off, the ship
completed repairs at Diego Garcia and is now enroute to rendezvous with
the carrier. Last week the carrier was tasked with conducting a port
call at Cape Town South Africa and is on its way back north to the
Somali coast. RFA Fort Victoria is returning from Bahrain with a full
load of provisions and a new helicopter for Cardiff.
