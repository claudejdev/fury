***HMS Illustrious* CVG**

*HMS Illustrious (Lusty)* has spent the past three months on patrol in
the Mediterranean, first enforcing the no-fly zone over Bosnia and
conducting sea interdiction in the Adriatic, then conducting an exercise
in the Eastern Med of Cyprus with the American Marine Expeditionary Unit
stationed there. She was on her way home when the Soviets struck, and
although not involved in the fighting on day one, but will receive her
baptism of fire on the second day of the war as she sails west towards
Malta on her way home to undergo a 4-month refit.
