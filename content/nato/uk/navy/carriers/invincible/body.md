***HMS Invincible* CVG**

*HMS Invincible (Vince)* had completed a minor refit in late 1993 and
was conducting fleet training with several RN ships and submarines in
the Celtic Sea between Wales and Ireland when the war started. She
immediately returned to Portsmouth to replenish and put to sea again
within 24 hours, still awaiting orders. Her first task of the war would
be an intimidating one, to stop the Soviet advance south of the Shetland
and Faro islands into the Atlantic. During the first three days of the
war however she had gained a formidable Battle Group, including a
slightly over crowded air group.
