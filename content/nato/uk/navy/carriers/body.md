**Royal Navy Aircraft Carriers**

Although the RN had more true aircraft carriers than any other NATO
country beside the United States. These three Invincible Class ships, by
any measurement must be considered light carriers when compared to
American Fleet Carriers. indeed, they are slightly more than half the
displacement of American Wasp and Tarawa class Amphibious Assault ships,
with a similar air group capacity. However, designed for Sea Control as
opposed to power projection, these ships were quite capable and often
acted as flagships for NATO task groups.

Class**](http://www.military-today.com/navy/invincible_class.htm)

The three carriers in this class were commissioned in the early 80â€™s and
are quite modern and capable ships with Sea Dart missiles and Phalanx
Close in Weapons Systems (CIWS). They generally carry a mixed air group
of 10-12 Sea Harriers and 8-10 Sea King helicopters but this air group
is often changed, increased or decreased based on the threat and task at
hand. RAF Harriers are often carried whenever amphibious or land based
operations are supported. With the three ships in the fleet, the RN
counted on having two at sea nearly continuously while the third
undergoes refit. At the start of Northern Fury, HMS Illustrious is
returning to the UK to commence refit while Invincible is at sea in home
waters and Ark Royal is departing South Africa for a tour up the east
coast of Africa.
