**Royal Navy Aviation**

With maritime patrol and most shore based tasks under the responsibility
of the RAF, the key focus of naval aviation in the RN is ship based
aircraft. Organized as the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), the roles can then be
broken down further into 1) Carrier based, 2) Escort based, 3)
Amphibious and 4) Training and support.

Some changes have been made to the squadron organization to accommodate
the modifications in the Northern Fury storyline. For instance, three
carrier air groups are maintained vice the two historically, this was
done using unallocated aircraft which existed, specific cases such as
augmenting with RAF Harriers on occasion, and where needed acquiring or
converting more airframes then actually existed.

**Carrier based Aviation**

The three RN aircraft carriers were small and therefore limited in the
size of air group they could carry and maintain. Therefore, there were
only two airframes normally deployed, the Sea Harrier and the Sea King,
although three different models of Sea King were used.

**[Sea Harrier
FA.2](https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/fa2-sea-harrier/)
(FRS.2)**

The famous [British Sea
Harrier](http://www.airvectors.net/avav8_2.html#m6) of Falkland Islands
fame was the FRS.1, although lauded as the hero of the war, it was found
wanting on many levels. Actual development of the much improved FRS.2
started in 1985 and first flew in ’88, deployment however was slow,
mostly due to budgetary constraints. Conversion of FRS.1 started in 1995
and completed in 1997 with new build arriving between 1995 and 1998. In
Northern Fury, conversion and new build began in 1991 and was completed
by the end of 1993. The FRS.2 (or FA.2) have the capability to fire the
Aim 120 AMRAAM air to air missile as well as precision strike ground
attack munitions. Of the 51 Sea Harriers available, plus seven converted
‘T Mark 8’ training aircraft, the RN in Northern Furry maintain three
operational Harrier squadrons and one training Squadron, with land bases
at Cottesmore and Yeovilton.

**Note**, the FRS.2 was re-designated FA.2 in the mid ‘90s, changing
from ‘Fighter, Reconnaissance, Strike’ to simply ‘Fighter Attack’. In
Northern Fury the FA.2 designation is used.

**[Sea
King](https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/sea-king-helicopter/)
(HAS.6, AEW.2, HAR.3, HC.4)**

The other routine member of the carrier air group is the Westland Sea
King. Usually there are a total of 10 on board including: Six
Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) versions, the HAS.6 (Helicopter
Anti-Submarine Mark 6); two Airborne Early Warning (AEW) versions, the
AEW.2A, and two Search and Rescue (SAR) versions, the HAR.3 (Helicopter
Air Rescue Mark 3). These come form a variety of squadrons and are the
workhorses of the fleet.

The fourth version of the Sea King in use with the RN was the
Cargo/Troop carrying version used for Amphibious operations, the HC.4.
In total there were 146 Sea Kings in the RN broken down by type as
follows:

-   76x HAS.6

-   10x AEW.2A

-   35x HC.4

-   19x HAR.3

-   6x HAR.3A (new build)

The only changes due to Northern Fury is some minor reorganization and
the early purchase of 6x HAR.3A for shore based SAR. Squadron
dispositions are:

**Escort Based Aviation**

All Destroyers and Frigates in the fleet are equipped with a single type
of ASW aircraft, the [Westland
Lynx](http://www.airvectors.net/avlynx_2.html#m2). This is a very
capable ASW platform used by the RN, the Germany Navy, the French Navy,
the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and many non-NATO countries. The RN
has largely upgraded to the HAS.3 versions which is capable of
Anti-Surface as well as Transport and ASW tasks, although there are
still some HAS.2 remaining on older ships. Additionally, in service
HAS.3’s are being upgraded to HMA.8’s or Super Lynx with larger engines,
new avionics and better sensors. At the start of Northern Fury there are
12x HAS.2 on the older Leander Frigates, 77x HAS.3 and HAS.3GM (with
additional radios for the Gulf War), and 18 HMA.8’s. One additional Sqn
has been added in Northern Fury but the overall numbers are only
increased by the retention of the older HAS.2 in order to equip the
older FF which were retained.

**Amphibious Forces Aviation**

Beside the Sea King HC.4’s discussed earlier, the key equipment for use
by the Royal Marines in amphibious operations was the [Westland
Gazelle](http://www.gazellesquadron.co.uk/about/westland-gazelle) AH.1.
These 12 Gazelle were operated by the Army Air Corps (AAC) 3 Command
Brigade Air Squadron (CBAS) which also operates six Lynx AH.1 in support
of 3 Commando Brigade. These helicopters would be embarked on amphibious
ships based on the requirements of the operation, depending on the
situation not all would be embarked but in theory the AAC could provide
more if the threat demanded it. The other main use for the Gazelle was
basic helicopter training for all other helicopter types using the HT.2.

| 3 CBAS | Cdo Bde Air Sqn | Yeovilton | 6   | Lynx AH.1    | AAC     |

**Training and support**

The RN fielded a full suite of training squadrons to bring pilots from
the very basic level in the Chipmunk, through basic jet training in the
Hawk (see RAF) and basic helicopter training in the Gazelle, and finally
training on the type the pilot would be assigned to. Training did not
end there as all units conducted refresher and qualification training.

For support the RN had a small fleet of executive jets and small
aircraft for transporting personnel and to and from operational
deployments or evacuating medical casualties.
