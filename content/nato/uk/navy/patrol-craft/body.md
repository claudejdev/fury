**Royal Navy Patrol Craft**

**<span class="underline">Patrol Craft</span>**

[**HMS Endurance
(A171)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Endurance_\(A171\))

As the only ‘Ice Patrol’ ship in the RN, the Endurance is a Class 1
Icebreaker which spends 18 out of every 24 months in the southern oceans
patrolling between the Falkland Islands, Antarctica and other British
possessions in the region. She has assisted the British Antarctic Survey
team by performing hydrographic surveys as well as environmental studies
and also featuring in several BBC documentaries. Her two Lynx HAS.3
helicopters are modified to operate in polar conditions.

[**Castle
Class**](http://www.armedforces.co.uk/navy/navycastleclass.htm)

These two ships share their time by conducting fisheries and
environmental patrols in the North Sea and as Guard ship in the
Falklands. They are able to accommodate a Sea King helicopter, 120
troops for a short time and act as minelayers. They are also equipped
with a detergent spraying apparatus for dispersing oil slicks.

[**Island
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island-class_patrol_vessel)

Primarily procured for fisheries patrol, these vessels also patrol the
North Sea oil and gas fields. They are lightly armed and can carry a
small detachment of Royal Marines. The class has suffered much criticism
over the years as being too small, too under equipped and too expensive
for their role.

[**Peacock
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock-class_corvette)

The five vessels in this class were constructed specifically for duty in
Hong Kong. They had the seakeeping ability to remain at sea during a
Typhoon and were fully air conditioned for operating in a tropical
climate. They perform a multitude of tasks including drug interdiction
and support to search and rescue. They are equipped with a decompression
chamber, two RHIBs and maintained a small detachment of Royal Marines.

[**Bird Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird-class_patrol_vessel)

Another disappointing class of patrol vessels. These five boats were
never used as intended due to very poor sea keeping. They were slow,
poorly armed, difficult to handle in any sort of weather and universally
despised. Two remained in the training role while three were based in
Northern Ireland.

**<span class="underline">Mine Craft</span>**

**HMS Wilton (M1116)**

Due for retirement later in 1994, this ship was the first in the world
to be constructed with glass reinforced plastic to give her a low
magnetic signature. After an active 20-year career, technology in mine
hunting has moved on, but she still has equipment that may be useful.
She is currently at Dartmouth on training duty.

[**River Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River-class_minesweeper)

The 12 vessels of this MCM (Mine Countermeasures) class were designed to
sweep for deep sea mines laid by Soviet submarines. Two of them
operating together would tow the Wire Sweep Mark 9 (WS 9) along the
seabed at great depth, cutting the mooring lines. Historically this
class, with the exception of one was operated by the RN Reserve but was
withdrawn from service in 1993; in Northern Fury they remain.

[**Hunt
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt-class_mine_countermeasures_vessel)

The Hunt class demonstrate the evolution from a mine sweeper such as the
River class to a true mine hunter. Equipped with two Remote Operated
Submersible Vehicles (ROV) and mine hunting sonar, they patrol a
suspected area to find mines, detach or disarm them then destroy them.
These vessels will often deploy with NATO mine countermeasures task
forces and there are currently six of 13 craft in the Persian Gulf.

[**Sandown
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandown-class_minehunter)

The first five of these advanced MCM are in service by 1994. These
vessels have a more cabable ROV, better sonars and a wider range of mine
hunting equipment to complement the Hunt and River classes. The Sandown
is currently in the Persian Gulf and one of these craft will be
stationed there on a rotational basis until the mission is complete.

| ------- | ------------- | ------ | -------- |
| M101    | HMS Sandown   | Active | Bahrain  |
| M102    | HMS Inverness | Active | Faslane  |
| M103    | HMS Cromer    | Active | Faslane  |
| M104    | HMS Walney    | Active | Faslane  |
| M105    | HMS Bridport  | Active | Faslane  |

[**PAP
ROV**](http://www.deagel.com/Protection-Systems/PAP-Mark-5_a002091001.aspx)

The RN uses PAP Mark 4 in the Hunt class MCMs and the PAP Mark 5 in the
Sandown Class. These ROV remain tethered to the mother vessel and
actively hunt for mines. Once they find a mine they can either set an
explosive charge to blow the mine up in place or cut the tether and let
the mine float to the surface where it will be engaged with deck guns
from the MCM.
