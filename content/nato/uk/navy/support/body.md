**Royal Navy Support Ships**

[**Fort Victoria Class
AOR**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Victoria-class_replenishment_oiler)

Only two of these AOR (Auxiliary Oiler, Replenishment) of a planed six
were built. They are of an equivalent size to some of the large American
oilers but more modern and fitted out for a variety of tasks. Even
though these are RFA (Royal Fleet Auxiliary) ships, they are armed, are
equipped with fairly sophisticated electronics and decoys and can house
up to five helicopters. With a storage capacity exceeding 12,500
m<sup>3</sup> for liquids and 6250 m<sup>3</sup> of dry goods,
refrigerated food and ammunition, one of the Fort class can supply a
task group for several days of intense operations by conducting
Replenishment At Sea (RAS). Operationally this was a major improvement
at the AOR replaced three other ships; an Oiler (AO), a stores ship
(AFS) and an ammunition replenishment ship (AFS or AE). These ships were
both commissioned in 1993 because Fort Victory was bombed by the Irish
Republican Army while under construction and nearly sunk. Repairs
(although quicker then historic) delayed her commissioning by 18
months.

Class
AFS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Rosalie-class_replenishment_ship)

Built in the ‘70’s these two ships are half the size of the Fort
Victoria and designed to replenish dry goods only and classified AFS
(Auxiliary, Fleet Stores) or Combat Stores Ship. They carry 3,500 tons
of stores including refrigerated goods. With an emergency landing deck
on top of the hanger and the ability to house four Sea King helicopters
they are often used for aviation training as a secondary
task.

**Resource Class AFS (or AEFS)**

![](/assets/images/nato/uk/navy/support/image3.jpeg)Designed at AFS
for fleet replenishment, both of these ships were primarily used to
replenish ammunition, although they could carry other dry goods, they
had some temperature controlled holds but did not have bulk
refrigeration. They could house helicopters but were not normally
provided with an embarked air
detachment.

[**Ol Class
AO**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol-class_tanker_\(1965\))

The three ships of this class are large ‘Fast Fleet Tankers’ (AO) were
designed to provide fuel to task forces at sea. They have a much larger
liquid capacity than the Fort Victory class but no (or very limited)
capacity to store dry goods. A fourth ship of this class was built and
sold to Iran as the Kharg. Historically RFA Olmeda was scrapped in Jan
94 but she is retained in Northern Fury. They have a helicopter deck
hanger, and can house up to three Sea
Kings.

[**Leaf Class AOT**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf-class_tanker)

The Leaf class is not a class in itself but a collection of similar
vessels charged with the same role. The main task of an AOT (Support
Tanker) is delivery of bulk fuel between bases, but they do have
capability to conduct
RAS.

[**Rover Class
(AOL)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rover-class_tanker)

The AOL or ‘Small Fleet Tanker’ was a handy way of assisting RN ships on
independent missions, while not tasking one of the larger replenishment
ships. The five Rover class carried 3,000 m<sup>3</sup> of fuel and
limited dry and refrigerated goods. A landing platform is provided for
VERTREP (Vertical Replenishment) but there is no provision for embarking
a
helicopter.

[**RFA Diligence
AR**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA_Diligence_\(A132\))

The Diligence (A132) is the RN’s forward repair ship (AR). Beginning her
life supporting North Sea oil rigs, the Diligence was contracted by the
RN for the Falklands war, then later purchased outright. During the
Persian Gulf War, because of her machine shop and repair facilities, she
assisted the USS Tripoli and Princeton after they were struck by mines.
She has many duties, including support of the RN’s Persian Gulf Mine
countermeasures force, provisioning and repairing SSNs patrolling east
of the Red Sea, responding to natural disasters and supporting other
requirements. Her helicopter deck can land anything up to a CH-47
Chinook, her hull is reinforced to withstand severe ice so she can
navigate in
![](/assets/images/nato/uk/navy/support/image7.jpeg)polar regions
without icebreaker assistance and she has a ‘dynamic positioning’ system
which keeps her stable and prevents drift in poor sea conditions.
Currently she is in Perth Australia assisting the repair of RFA Green
Rover after a major engine failure.

[**RFA Argus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA_Argus_\(A135\))

Although contracted for the Falklands as a container ship, the Argus
(A135) was purchased in the late ‘80s as an Aviation Training Ship.
Since then has also been used as amphibious support ship
(unsatisfactorily) and a ‘Casualty Receiving Ship’, her armament and
paint colour not allowing her to be called a Hospital ship. Her medical
facilities are extensive and include CT-scan, Intensive Care Unit,
surgery and a 70 bed holding ward. Her flight deck is configured to
train pilots for landing both on the aircraft carriers and small deck
ships, although she does not have a bow ramp needed to launch combat
loaded Harriers. She is currently in port at Southampton.
