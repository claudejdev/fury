The UK is one of the founding members of NATO and is arguably the second
most important military power behind the US. This status is arguable
because Germany, Turkey and Italy, not to mention France have become
increasingly important while the UK military forces have shrunk
considerably since the formation of the Alliance. In 1994 the British
military had reduced to about 250,000 personnel, relatively small
compared to other nations and a shadow of its former strength, but this
force was technologically advanced and highly proficient.

Territorial commitments, disputes and agreements are too numerous to
mention but the UK has global commitments which it struggles to
maintain. For a better understanding of the entities that make up the
UK, you may wish to watch this humorous but

despite the difficulties, since the 1982 Falklands war the downward
spiral of funding and neglect has stopped and British forces have been a
keystone force in the Gulf War, Yugoslavia and Bosnia. There are also
continuing commitments to Northern Ireland, Belize, Brunei, Hong Kong,
Kenya, Cyprus and Gibraltar.
