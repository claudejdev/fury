The UK is one of the founding members of NATO and is arguably the second
most important military power behind the US. This status is arguable
because Germany, Turkey and Italy, not to mention France have become
increasingly important while the UK military forces have shrunk
considerably since the formation of the Alliance. For a better
understanding of the entities that make up the UK, you may wish to watch
this humorous but accurateÂ video. In 1994 the British military had
reduced to about 250,000 personnel, but was technologically advanced and
highly proficient.

Territorial commitments, disputes and agreements are too numerous to
mention but the UK has global commitments which it struggles to
maintain. However, despite the difficulties since 1982 the British
forces have fought and won in the Falklands, the Gulf War, Yugoslavia
and Bosnia, along with a continuing commitment to Northern Ireland,
Belize, Brunei, Hong Kong, Kenya, Cyprus and Gibraltar.
