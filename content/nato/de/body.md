Although Germany reunified in 1990, all is not celebrations and roses in the Northern Fury world. With the Soviet Union in resurgence, economic pressures in Germany and a political movement to leave NATO has caused significant instability in Berlin and throughout northern and eastern Germany in particular. Strong internal movements in Bavaria have been a counter to the left wing movements in the north causing further disunity.\n\nMilitarily, unification did little to boost Germany‘s capabilities. Most of the ships were sold off or simply scrapped. Germany retained seven patrol boats, an icebreaker, survey ship and several smaller craft. A list of the actual transfers can be found here. The air force of the former East Germany held some 1000 aircraft, all but a single squadron of 22 MiG-29‘s were sold off or scrapped within six months of reunification. The Bundeswehr was reduced to 370,000 personnel. This was Germany‘s contribution to the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe. As a result, the Bundeswehr was significantly reduced, and the former East German National Volksarmee (NVA) was disbanded.
