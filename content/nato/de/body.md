Although Germany reunified in 1990, all is not celebrations and roses in
the Northern Fury world. With the Soviet Union in resurgence, economic
pressures in Germany and a political movement to leave NATO has caused
significant instability in Berlin and throughout Germany, the north and
east in particular. Strong internal pressure in Bavaria have been a
counter to the left-wing sentiment in the north causing further
disunity.

Militarily, unification did little to boost Germany's capabilities.
Historically most of the ships and aircraft from East Germany were sold
off or simply scrapped, but in Northern Fury most of these were
transferred back to the Soviet Union or other Warsaw Pact countries.
Germany retained seven patrol boats, an icebreaker, survey ship and
several smaller craft plus a single squadron of MiG-29's. A major impact
of unification saw the Bundeswehr significantly reduced to 370,000
personnel and the former East German National Volksarmee (NVA)
completely disbanded.
