Although Germany reunified in 1990, all is not celebrations and roses in
the Northern Fury world. With the Soviet Union in resurgence; economic
pressures in Germany and a political movement to leave NATO has caused
significant instability in Berlin and throughout Germany, the north and
east in particular. Strong internal movements in Bavaria have been a
counter to the left wing movements in the north causing further
disunity.

Militarily, unification did little to boost Germany's capabilities.
Historically most of the ships and aircraft were sold off or simply
scrapped, but in Northern Fury most of these were transferred back to
the Soviet Union or other Warsaw Pact countries. Germany retained seven
patrol boats, an icebreaker, survey ship and several smaller craft plus
a single squadron of MiG-29's. The Bundeswehr was significantly reduced
to 370,000 personnel and the former East German National Volksarmee
(NVA) was disbanded.
