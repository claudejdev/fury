**German Navy**

The Bundesmarine is primarily a focused on control of the western Baltic
sea, although they have interests in the North Sea and routinely send
units to exercise and patrol with NATO forces. Maintaining Naval bases
on both sides of the Jutland peninsula; Kiel on the Baltic in the east
and Wilhelmshaven on the North Sea in the West joined by the Kiel canal
for the exact purpose of transferring naval power form one coast to the
other adds significant flexibility. As a rule, the larger ships, except
the Lutjens Class Destroyers are based at Wilhelmshaven with easy access
to the North Sea and Atlantic while the submarines, patrol boats, mine
warfare craft and missile boats are at Kiel ready to join the Danes in
defending the Baltic Approaches.

[**Hamburg
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg-class_destroyer): Built
in the early 1960s these were the first warships built in Germany since
the Second World War. They were not popular, had many faults, poor sea
keeping characteristics, but they were useful in demonstrating that
Germany could help protect the sea lanes that were key to its renewed
growth. Built as an all gun ship, modernization in the 1980s replaced
one of the 100mm gun turrets with Exocet Anti-Ship Missiles (ASM),
obsolete Bofors guns were replaced with new Breda L70 40mm cannon, the
radar and combat systems were improved. One of the original four ships
retired in 1990 and the remaining three were historically decommissioned
between December 1993 and December 1994, in Northern Fury those three
remain active.

**[Lutjens](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/French-Navy/Destroyer-Frigate/D-609-FS-Aconit.htm)
Class**: These three ships were derived from the US Charles F. Adams
Class of DDGs, although the differences between the two were not
operationally significant. The primary role of this class was air
defence and had been upgraded over time to field both the Standard
SM-1MR medium range Surface to Air Missiles (SAM) and the RAM (Rolling
Airframe Missile) short range SAM. Considering that they were built in
1969/70, their air defense capabilities were quite good.

**[Bremen
Class](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/German-Navy/Frigate/Type-122-Bremen-class.htm):**
The eight ships of this class form the backbone of the Germany Navy.
Designed for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) using the Dutch design for the
very successful
[Kortenaer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kortenaer-class_frigate) Class
as a basis, they were all commissioned between 1982 and 1990 and were
well rounded ships. The main purpose was protecting the sea lanes and
contributing to convoy operations. They each carried two Lynx ASW
helicopters, Harpoon ASMs and short range Sea-Sparrow SAMs and are being
fitted with the RAM system as well.

[**Brandenburg
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/German-Navy/Frigate/Type-123-Brandenburg-class.htm):
FGS Brandenburg is the first of a four ship class designed to replace
the Hamburg Class Destroyers. Her construction has been accelerated by
about six months due to the re-emerging threat, and is in Wilhelmshaven
completing her final fitting out before commissioning at war start. The
other three ships have also been accelerated but are at least a year
away from commissioning. Equipped with 2 Lynx ASW helicopters, Exocet
ASM, Sea Sparrow, RAM and very modern sensors, these will be a valuable
addition to the fleet.

**Fast Attack Craft:** The role of these ships is to defend the western
end of the Baltic sea and in conjunction with the Danish Navy, prevent
Soviet forces from escaping through the Baltic Approaches into the North
Sea. All are based at Neustadt Navy Base, 40 nautical miles South East
of Kiel and remain at high readiness to sortie quickly against any
threat. The NATO pennant numbers are prefixed with ‘P’ while the local
German pennant number is only two digits and is prefixed with an ‘S’.

[**Albatros
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/German-Navy/Patrol-Vessel/Type-143-Albatros-class.htm):
Equipped with Exocet ASMs, torpedoes, and two 76mm Oto-Melara gun, these
400 tonne boats attack at 40Knts and depend on their speed,
maneuverability and a few decoys to escape.

[**Gepard
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/German-Navy/Patrol-Vessel/Type-143A-Gepard-class.htm):
Similarly equipped to the Albatros Class, the Gepards are a decade
newer, have only one gun, more decoys and are equipped with the RAM
short range SAM system with 21 missiles.

[**Tiger
Class**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/German-Navy/Patrol-Vessel/Type-143A-Gepard-class.htm):
The oldest of the three classes of FAC in the German Navy, these have
Exocet ASMs and two Oto-Melara 76mm guns, but also a Bofors 40mm gun
instead of SAMs. Slightly slower and 130 tonnes lighter than the other
two classes, the 20 boats of the Tiger Class will have difficulty
surviving in the highly contested Baltic Approaches.

**Submarines:** German shipyards build some of the best diesel powered
submarines in the world – for other navies! The only submarines, or
U-Boats operated by the Germany Navy are the Type 205 and 206 designs,
far smaller and less effective, but cheaper to build and operate than
the Type 209/210 designs that are used by a dozen (in 1994) countries
around the world. Design and testing is ongoing for the most advanced
versions of the type 209 and even the type 212/214. Still the German
boats are very effective and well suited for the shallow and confined
waters of the Baltic Sea.

[**Type
205/205A**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/German-Navy/Submarine/Type-205-class.htm):
Only four boats remain active in this class, although two were supposed
to retire in 1993, they did not. At a displacement of 450 tonnes
submerged and with a crew of 22, these are very small, but also very
quiet subs. The Type 205 had a single hull, the Type 205A had a double
hull, neither were non-magnetic but had hulls made of a much better and
less magnetic steel than earlier designs.

[**Type
206**](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/German-Navy/Submarine/Type-206-class.htm):
This type is not much larger than the Type 205 but its systems are more
advanced and it has a non-magnetic steel hull. 18 were built and 12 were
upgraded to the Type 206A standard with a new sonar, periscopes, weapons
control system, ability to use newer torpedoes and a refurbished
propulsion system.
