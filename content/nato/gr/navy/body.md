**Greek Navy**

The Greek Navy in Northern Fury is in a difficult position. Since the
USN was holding onto older ships in order to satisfy their 600 ship navy
commitment, the sale of 5 Charles F. Adams Class DDGs and 3 Knox Class
FFs did not occur, so the 8 Ex-Gearing class DDs were retained.
Similarly the 8 Dutch Kortenaer class FFGs remained in the Netherlands
navy and were not transferred. To compensate for these shortfalls, the
Hellenic Navy commissioned another two Hydra class (MEKO-200) FFGs which
were built in Germany in order to expedite construction.

**Destroyers**

In Northern Fury all eight destroyers in the Hellenic Navy are Ex US
Gearing/Sumner class, launched near the end of World War Two and
upgraded in the 1960s under the USNs Fleet Rehabilitation and
Modernization (FRAM) program. The two ships of the Themistoklis Class
were FRAM II ships focusing on Anti-Surface warfare (ASuW) while the six
ships of the Kanaris class focused on Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW)
operations

**Themistoklis Class:** These two DDs, one previously a Gearing and the
other an Allen M. Sumner class both FRAM II, are equipped with 6x 5”
guns in twin turrets, torpedo tubes a flight deck and small hanger but
no facilities for a permanent helicopter. These ships are well past
their prime and rarely sail.

**Kanaris Class:** Outfitted for ASW work, these six ships are all based
on Gearing FRAM I hulls. They only have 2x 5” twin turrets, but also
carry 8x Harpoon ASuW missiles, ASW rockets (ASROC), an Oto Melara 76mm
gun for air defence but no flight deck.

**Frigates**

**Elli Class**: The two Elli Class were new build Kortenaer class ships
which Greece received in the early 1980s. These were excellent ships of
Dutch design but the eight sister ships were kept in Dutch service and
not transferred to Greece beginning in 1993. These ships have a very
modern propulsion system, aircraft facilities for two AB-212 ASW
helicopters, 8x Harpoon missiles, Sea Sparrow air defence missiles, an
Oto-Melara 76mm gun and Phalanx Close In Weapons System (CIWS).

**Hydra Class (MEKO 200)**: This is a German designed modular warship
with several variations, in three basic configurations (MEKO 140, 200,
360), the MEKO 200 is the most prolific with six nations either
operating or building the design. The Hellenic Navy’s Hydra Class are
large (3,200 tons) capable and well-rounded ships with Harpoon ASMs, Sea
Sparrow air defence missiles, 2x CIWS, a 5” gun and facilities for an
S-70B Seahawk helicopter. Six ships of this class were approved in 1988
and historically one was built in Germany, two were canceled and three
were completed after long delays in Greece. For Northern Fury the
evolving Soviet threat and the lack of other ship transfers spurred the
building program so that the two canceled ships were built in Germany,
both completing in 1993 while one locally built has been commissioned
and the other two will come into service later in 1994.

**Fast Attack Craft (FAC)**

As with the larger ships, Greece was at the mercy of other navies, in
this case Germany. When the threat increased and Germany held on to her
military /assets, Greece did not receive six cast-off Combattant IIa
class ships. Beginning in the 1970s Greece began operating La Combattant
FACs in the Aegean Sea as an inexpensive and effective way of countering
any threat in those confined and busy waters. Over the years more boats
were added; 14 boats in service in 1994, the six from Germany would have
allowed retirement of some of the older craft but the numbers would have
remained stable.

Gun Boats

There are three main classes of small gun boats used by the Hellenic
Navy, the common factor is size, between 550 and 600 tons, speed of
about 24 knts, and role – to patrol the hundreds of Greek islands in the
Aegean archipelago. The Thetis boats have an ASW capability but the two
Osprey types are simply gunboats.

Class LST**: These two ‘Landing Ship Tank’ of the World War Two
‘Terrebonne Parish-class’ were transferred to Greece in the early 1970s
after many years of service for the USN in both Korea and Viet Nam as
well as other service.

**Casa Grande LSD**: Another World War Two design, this ship was
commissioned immediately after the war and transferred to Greece in
1971.

**Ikaria/Samos LST**: These are truly World War Two veterans, the two
Ikarias transferred to Greece after service in Korea and Viet Nam, while
the six Samos class were delivered in the early 1950s.

**Grigoropoulos class LSM**: More veterans transferred in 1958.

**Submarines**

Greece operates eight submarines of the German Type 209 design. Four are
the older Type 209-1100 and four of the Harpoon missile capable Type
209-1200. These are very capable and agile submarines ideal for the
restricted water of the Aegean Sea.
