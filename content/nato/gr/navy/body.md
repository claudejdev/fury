The Elli class was a lengthened and modified version of the Dutch Kortenaer Class, the next two ships on the list were the first of six Kortenaer‘s that Greece purchased from the Dutch, the remaining four will remain in Dutch service for this campaign; the first of four Meko 200 class ships, the Hydra was built in Germany while the remaining examples were built in Greece and would be several more years in construction. The purchase of three Knox class from the US was canceled but was used as leverage to carry on with the purchase of F-16‘s, as detailed in the Air Force section.\n\nPennant\n\nClass\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nRemarks\n\nF 450\n\nElli\n\nElli\n\nKortenaer variant\n\nF 451\n\nLimnos\n\nF 459\n\nKortenaer\n\nAdrias\n\nF 460\n\nAigaion\n\nF 452\n\nMeko 200\n\nHydra\n\n![](images/greece navy/Elli-class-Batch-I-768x432.jpg)\n\nElli Class\n\n \n\n![](images/greece navy/Adrias_F459-768x509.jpg)\n\nF 459 HS Adrias\n\n \n\n![](images/greece navy/Hydra.jpg)\n\nHS Hydra\n\n \n\n**Fast Attack Craft**: In the restricted waters of the Aegean Sea this type of craft become far more powerful than their diminutive size would indicate.
