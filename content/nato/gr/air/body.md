**Greek Air Force**

The Hellenic Air Force (HAF) maintains a large and mixed inventory; some
very capable modern aircraft are entering service but many less capable
and almost obsolete aircraft remain.

[**F-16**](http://www.f-16.net/f-16_users_article5.html)

Greece received 40x F-16 Block 30 (34 C & 6 D) airframes 1988/90 under
the Peace Xenia I program, the last foreign sale of this type the US
conducted within Northern Fury. Peace Xenia I was very closely linked
with Peace Onyx I which was the sale of F-16s to Turkey. Initially
concentrated at Néa Anghialos in 111<sup>th</sup> Combat Wing, a new
squadron has just formed at Lárissa.

[**Mirage
2000**](http://www.military-today.com/aircraft/dassault_mirage_2000bc.htm)

As part of the general modernization of the Greek air force in the 1980s
40 Mirage 2000Es (4 were two seat ‘BG’ trainers) were purchased. These
were the first 4<sup>th</sup> generation aircraft employed by Greece and
they were primarily meant for the air superiority role. They deployed to
the 114<sup>th</sup> Combat Wing at Tanagra which was already operating
the Mirage F.1CG.

[**Mirage
F.1**](http://www.military-today.com/aircraft/dassault_mirage_f1.htm)

The Mirage F.1 was rushed into service in response to the Turkish
invasion of Cyprus and the Greek withdrawal from NATO which quickly
followed. France diverted some aircraft that were destined for its own
air force in order to fill the requirement. No two seat trainers were
acquired, only 40 F.1C modified to fire Sidewinder missiles (designated
F.1CG), delivered from 1975-77. Although these were considered
3<sup>rd</sup> generation multi role aircraft, Greece was primarily
interested in their Air to Air capability as they had A-7 Corsairs to
focus on the bombing role.

[**F-4 Phantom**](https://www.haf.gr/en/equipment/f-4e-phantom-ii/)

The F-4 was another 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation multi role fighter which
was acquired quickly in the early ‘70s, significantly modernizing the
HAFs capability. Greece started receiving the first of 56 new build F-4E
Phantom IIs in 1974, and then received 28 ex USAF F-4Es in 1991. In
addition, the initial arrangement provided for six RF-4Es which were
augmented by ex-Luftwaffe aircraft in 1993. In total four squadrons in
two wings operate the F-4E and one squadron operates the RF-4E.

[**F-5 Freedom
Fighter**](http://www.the-northrop-f-5-enthusiast-page.info/AirForces/GreeceAF.html)

Due for retirement and replacement by the F-16, some F-5s have been
retained to counter the growing threat in Bulgaria. By 1994 about half
of the F-5s originally operated by the Greek air force were still in
operation.

[**F-104
Starfighter**](http://greek-war-equipment.blogspot.com/2009/05/f-104-starfighter.html)

Another aircraft retained beyond its planned retirement date of 1993 was
the F-104 Starfighter. As the Greek government tries to find solutions
to the US reluctance to sell more F-16s, an upgrade program similar to
the Italian F-104 ASM is being entertained.

[**A-7 Corsair II**](https://www.airvectors.net/ava7.html#m5)

One veteran aircraft the Greek air force has no intention of retiring is
the A-7H Corsair II. The SLUF (Short Little Ugly Fellow) is a venerable
bomb truck with a massive range. Greece was the only non US country to
receive new production Corsairs and the first foreign country to operate
them in 1975. There were 60 newly built plus an additional 36 surplus
A-7Es in service by the early ‘90s.

**Transport Aircraft**

Three different types of transport aircraft are in use, all operated by
the 112<sup>th</sup> Combat Wing.
