**Portuguese Air Force**

The Portuguese Air Force is in transition. After several decades
focusing on Colonial issues, primarily in Africa, the *Força Aérea
Portuguesa* are struggling to dispose of older 1950’s based aircraft and
become more modern. World tension however is making that difficult.
Without a domestic aircraft industry to speak of, Portugal is at the
mercy of suppliers. Because it allows the US to use the key base at
Lajes on the Azores Portugal is now, after significant diplomatic
effort, being compensated and is in the process of receiving their first
Squadron of F-16’s from the US.

Against the wishes of the USAF, which is working hard to use every F-16
available, the US Government has recently provided Portugal with 20
F-16s through the Peace Atlantis I program as payment for the use of
Lajes Air Base in the Azors. The first six have been delivered a few
months earlier than historic, the 4x F-16A and 2 F-16B are Block 15 OCU
(Operational Capability Upgrade) and almost identical to the US Air
National Guard ADF (Air Defence Fighter) used for NORAD tasks.
Therefore, they have the ability to fire the Aim-7M Sparrow and Aim-9L
Sidewinder missiles

**A-7 Corsair**

A large portion of the Portuguese air force is committed to the A-7P
light attack aircraft which were second hand US Navy aircraft upgraded
to the latest variant. Two Squadrons operate out of Monte Real. These
30-year-old workhorses are rugged but well used and will eventually be
replaced by F-16s.

**Alpha Jet**

In another ‘Aircraft for Base’ deal, Germany has supplied Portugal with
50 Dornier Alpha Jets as compensation for using the base at Beja as the
Luftwaffe’s air combat training center. Although Germany was going to
renege on the deal (in Northern Fury), pressure from the US, UK, France
and Spain convinced them to deliver. These aircraft replaced the aging
Fiat G.91s in the close support role and the 1950’s era Cessna T-37
Tweet in the attack training role.

**C-130 Hercules**

The Portuguese operate 6 ‘H’ model Hercules, although 3 are the more
modern H2 and H3 versions. Tactual transport and general duties keep
them quite busy.

**C-212 Avocar**

Twenty-four of these very versatile, European built tactical transports
of several variants are used by the Portuguese Air Force. Shown here is
one of the two the Maritime Patrol Variant with a radar in the nose and
a magnetic anomaly detector along the forward fuselage. Two Electronic
Warfare (EW), two Photo Reconnaissance (PR) and 16 general transport
variants are also used.

**P3P Orion**

The Portuguese Air Force, which is also responsible for Maritime Patrol
and support to the Navy has been operating the P-3 Orion since 1985.
These six aircraft were surplus Australian P-3Bs upgraded to a ‘C’
standard. Flown by 601 Squadron Lobos (Wolves) they operate out of Beja
but routinely have aircraft at Lejes in the Azores. This unit operates
with both American and Spanish P-3’s conducting ASW duties in the
Eastern Atlantic and particularly on the approaches to the Mediterranean
Sea.

**Falcon 20 & 50**

Portugal operates three Falcon 20 and two Falcon 50 for general and VIP
transport, medical emergencies and other high priority duties.

[**Alouette
III**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sud_Aviation_Alouette_III_in_Portuguese_service)

Originally Portugal operated 142 of these like utility/transport
helicopters, primarily to support the army during colonial wars in
Africa in the 60s’ and 70s’ but this number has been reduced to about
24. Historically after budget cuts in 1986 and 1993 this was reduced to
eight helicopters but in Northern Fury these final cuts were either not
made or reversed. These helicopters are used for general transport,
tactical support of the army and navy, flight instruction, and air
demonstration team and coastal search and rescue.
