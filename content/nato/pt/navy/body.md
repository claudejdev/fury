**Portuguese Navy**

The Portuguese Navy (*Marinha de Guerra Portuguesa) traces its history
back to the 12<sup>th</sup> Century through colonial exploration to the
modern day. Most of Portugal’s ships are lightly armed and designed for
overseas duties in a low threat environment, although they are effective
in exerting influence in former colonies they are rather anemic by
European and North Atlantic standards. A agreement with Britain to
purchase the Rover Class fleet support tanker (RFA Blue Rover) was not
executed in the Northern Fury world, leaving the Portuguese Navy
dependent on others for at sea replenishment.*

***Vasco Da Gama Class**:*

As an exception to the rule, these three ships were commissioned in 1991
and 92, and are based on the German MEKO 200 design and are very capable
warships. They are well rounded patrol ships but lack variable depth
sonar or area air defence systems. They carry two Lynx helicopters,
Harpoon Missiles and Sea Sparrow short range air defence. All are based
in
Lisbon.

[**João Coutinho
class**:](http://www.military-today.com/navy/joao_coutinho_class.htm)
These 25-year-old ships were small and inexpensive to operate, but with
the correlation that they were very poorly equipped in either weapons or
sensors. Meant as a Patrol Frigate (most references call them
Corvettes), they spent much of their life traveling the globe.

**[João Belo-class
frigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Belo-class_frigate):**
Another class of small Frigates, although these are better equipped than
the F 471 class, but their weapons suite is still quite light by 1994
standards. The third 100mm gun has been removed from F 480 during her
mid life refit, as will the others as they proceed through the process
over the next few years.

**[Baptista de Andrade
class](http://www.military-today.com/navy/baptista_andrade_class.htm):**
The four ships of this class are quite similar to the João Coutinho
class, although the Baptista class is slightly better armed and
equipped, the Portuguese navy liked the Coutinho class better. The
original intent of these ships is somewhat of a mystery, there is a good
chance that they were destined to be delivered to South Africa during
the Apartheid era international Arms Embargo, those plans were probably
canceled with a change of Portuguese government and obviously did not
happen. Another effort to sell the ships to Columbia fell through in
1977.

**Albatroz Class Patrol Boats**: Originally meant to patrol the waters
in Portuguese colonies, the only examples remaining overseas in 1994 are
two in East Timor. The other four have been pulled out of former African
colonies and taken up duties in the Lisbon area.

**Albacora Class**

The first submarines to serve in the Portuguese Navy, the Albacora class
were based on the successful French Daphne boats. These are very capable
submarines able to patrol both coastal and deep ocean areas. A fourth
submarine of this class was sold to the Pakistani Navy in 1975.
