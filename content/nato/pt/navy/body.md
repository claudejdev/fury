**Portuguese Navy**

The Portuguese Navy (*Marinha de Guerra Portuguesa)* traces its history
back to the 12<sup>th</sup> Century through colonial exploration to the
modern day. Most of Portugal’s ships are lightly armed and designed for
overseas duties in a low threat environment, although they are effective
in exerting influence in former colonies they are rather anemic by
European and North Atlantic standards. An agreement with Britain to
purchase the Rover Class fleet support tanker (***RFA Blue Rover***) was
not executed in the Northern Fury world, leaving the Portuguese Navy
dependent on others for at sea replenishment.

**Vasco Da Gama Class**:

As an exception to the rule, these three ships were commissioned in 1991
and 92, are based on the German MEKO 200 design and are very capable
general purpose warships. They are well rounded patrol ships but lack
variable depth sonar or area air defence systems. They carry two Lynx
helicopters, Harpoon Missiles and Sea Sparrow short range air defence.
All are based in Lisbon.

[**João Coutinho
class**:](http://www.military-today.com/navy/joao_coutinho_class.htm)
These 25-year-old ships were small and inexpensive to operate, but with
the correlation that they were very poorly equipped in both weapons and
sensors. Meant as a Patrol Frigate (most references call them
Corvettes), they spent much of their life traveling the globe.

**[João Belo-class
frigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_Belo-class_frigate):**
Another class of small Frigates, although these are better equipped than
the F 471 class, their weapons suite is still quite light by 1994
standards. The third 100mm gun has been removed from F 480 during her
mid life refit, and will be removed from the others as they proceed
through the process over the next few years.

**[Baptista de Andrade
class](http://www.military-today.com/navy/baptista_andrade_class.htm):**
The four ships of this class are quite similar to the João Coutinho
class, although the Baptista class is slightly better equipped, the
Coutinho class was more popular in the navy. The original intent of
these ships is somewhat of a mystery, there is a good chance that they
were destined to be delivered to South Africa during the Apartheid era
international Arms Embargo; those plans were probably canceled with a
change of Portuguese government and obviously did not happen. Another
effort to sell the ships to Columbia fell through in 1977.

else, but are efficient to operate.

[**Albatroz Class Patrol
Boats**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albatroz-class_patrol_boat):

examples remaining overseas in 1994 are two in East Timor. The other
four have been pulled out of former African colonies and taken up duties
in the Lisbon area.

[**Albacora
Class**](http://www.navypedia.org/ships/portugal/pr_ss_albacora.htm)

The first submarines to serve in the Portuguese Navy, the Albacora class
were based on the successful French Daphne boats. These are very capable
submarines able to patrol both coastal and deep ocean areas. A fourth
submarine of this class was sold to the Pakistani Navy in 1975.
