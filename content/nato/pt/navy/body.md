**Portuguese Navy** - The Portuguese Navy (_Marinha de Guerra Portuguesa_) traces its history back to the 12th Century through colonial exploration to the modern day. Unfortunately, most of Portugal‘s ships lightly armed and designed for overseas duties in a low threat environment, although they were effective in exerting influence in former colonies they are rather anemic by European and North Atlantic standards. A agreement with Britain to purchase the Rover Class fleet support tanker (RFA Blue Rover) was not executed in the Northern Fury world, leaving the Portuguese Navy dependent on others for at sea replenishment.

Vasco Da Gama Class

**Vasco Da Gama Class**: As an exception to the rule, these three ships were commissioned in 1991 and 92, and are based on the German MEKO 200 design. They are capable patrol ships but lack variable depth sonar or area air defence systems. They carry two Lynx helicopters, Harpoon Missiles and Sea Sparrow short range air defence. All are based in Lisbon.

João Coutinho Class

**João Coutinho Class**: These 25-year-old ships were small and inexpensive to operate, but with the correlation that they were very poorly equipped in either weapons or sensors. Meant as a Patrol Frigate (most references call them Corvettes), they spent much of their life traveling the globe.

| Pennant | Name                  | Location    |

| F471    | António Enes          | Lisbon      |
| F475    | João Coutinho         | Azors       |

| F484    | Augusto de Castilho   | Lisbon      |
| F485    | Honório Barreto       | Pacific     |

João Belo Class

**João Belo Class Frigate**: Another class of small Frigates, although these are better equipped that the F 471 class, their weapons suite is still quite anemic by 1994 standards. The third 100mm gun has been removed from F 480 during her mid life refit, as will the others as they proceed through the process over the next few years.

| Pennant | Name                           | Location  |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| F480    | Comandante João Belo           | Lisbon    |
| F481    | Comandante Hermenegildo Capelo | North Sea |
| F482    | Comandante Roberto Ivens       | Refit     |
| F483    | Comandante Sacadura Cabral     | Lisbon    |

Baptista de Andrade Class

**Baptista de Andrade Class**: The four ships of this class are quite similar to the João Coutinho class, although the Baptista class is slightly better armed and equipped, the Portuguese navy liked the Coutinho class better. The original intent of this class is somewhat of a mystery, there is a good chance that they were destined to be delivered to South Africa during the Arms Embargo that was preventing any modernization, that obviously did not happen. Another effort to sell the ships to Columbia fell through in 1977 as well.

| Pennant | Name                | Location       |
| ------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| F486    | Baptista de Andrade | Gibraltar area |
| F487    | João Roby           | Lisbon         |
| F488    | Afonso Cerqueira    | Pacific        |
| F489    | Oliveira e Carmo    | Lisbon         |

Albatroz Class

**Albatroz Class Patrol Boats**: Originally meant to patrol the waters in Portuguese colonies, the only ones remaining over seas in 1994 are two in East Timor. The other four have been pulled out of the former African colonies and have taken up duties in the Lisbon area.

Albacora Class
