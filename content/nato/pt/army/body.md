The Portuguese army is a small conscript force which maintains key functions at high readiness and maintains basic skill sets for rapid mobilization. Structurally they have a Corps HQ, but in reality this formation would function at the Divisional level and either remain in Portugal to enable mobilization or deploy with the Mechanized Brigade to NATO‘s Southern Army Group (SOUTHAG). The standing army was 44,000 personnel with about 175,000 reserves. ![](images/Portuguese Army_files/image001.png)

The majority of the Portuguese Army is ‘light‘. The units are either specialized light infantry such as the Paratroop Brigade which is controlled by the Air Force, the Marines which are controlled by the Navy or the Commandos who are tasked by the national HQ, or lightly equipped regional forces. The one mechanized formation ‘1a Brigada Mista Independiente‘ or 1st Mixed Brigade has an armored battalion (M60A3 TTS), a mechanized battalion (M-113) and a motorized battalion (trucks). The garrison units are unique; they are based on a light infantry battalion but have a battery of 105mm artillery, a reconnaissance squadron and air defence.

These replaced M-48s which were returned to the US. These are standard M60A3 with a Thermal imaging targeting site added to improve night and poor visibility operations. Most, (53) of these MBTs are in the Armored Battalion of the Mixed Brigade while the remainder are in the Cavalry (Reconnaissance) Squadron and training school.

Other variants of this family of vehicles being used are the command post (M577), the TOW missile carrier (M901), the 107mm mortar carrier (M106) and the 81mm mortar carrier (M125), and 20mm Vulcan (M163A1). The remainder of the M113s are spread throughout the regional brigades and training schools.
