One of the 12 founding members of NATO, Portugal with a population of 10
million and a low GDP was also the poorest by most measurements.
Ultra-ideological policies, a transition from colonialism to socialism
and then finally to a liberal democracy, all left the economy in a state
of turmoil requiring the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to step in
with stabilization programs in the 70's and again in the 80's. After
joining the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1986, the economy
improved substantially.

The troubled political and economic situation did not leave much room
for military development. Although one of the smaller forces in NATO,
Portugal maintains several key bases, critical for security of
Trans-Atlantic commerce, particularly Lejas in the Azors but also the
Cape Verde Islands and Madeira. Germany uses the Portuguese base of Baja
for its air combat training, and the HQ for Commander-in-Chief Iberian
Atlantic (CINCIBERLANT) is located just west of Lisbon at Oeiras.
