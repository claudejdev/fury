**Danish Air Force**

The Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF) is primarily focused on defence of the
Baltic Approaches and will be largely detached to under command of
Allied Air Forces Baltic Approaches (AIRBALTAP) in times of war. The two
main roles envisioned by this force are to defend the airspace to allow
reinforcement squadrons to arrive from the UK and US and to prevent
Warsaw Pact surface forces access to the North Sea. To do this the bulk
of the RDAF is focused on four squadrons of F-16s and two squadrons of
F-35 Drakan’s.

[**F-16**](http://www.f-16.net/f-16_users_article3.html)

Denmark is one of four European nations to participate in the production
of F-16s in Belgium and the Netherlands. In total the Danes acquired 70
examples, (54 F-16As and 16 F-16Bs) all are of the Block 10/15 standard
with a Danish built chaff dispenser system. They are organized in four
squadrons and reside in two bases, 723 Squadron has the added role of
conducting initial and continuation training.

[**F-35 Draken**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saab_35_Draken)

To fulfill the surface strike role, Denmark purchased a heavily modified
version of the Swedish SAAB 35 Draken. The SAAB 35 XD or to Denmark the
F-35, converted the original interceptor design into a strike fighter
able to carry a large bomb load and Bullpup missiles. Of the 51
purchased, 20 were the baseline strike aircraft (F-35), a further 20
were a reconnaissance version RF-35 and 11 were a two seat training
version TF-35. In addition to their front line aircraft, each of the two
squadrons maintained five of the TF-35 twin seat versions for training.
Both squadrons were projected to operate into the late 90’s but were
disbanded in 1992 due to the end of the Cold War – they remain for
Northern Fury.
