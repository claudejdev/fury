**Denmark:** The [Kingdom of
Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) is one of the original
12 NATO signatories and relies heavily on collective defence for its
survival in conflict. Geographically small with a population of 5.2
million, Denmark has Trans-Atlantic responsibilities as it administers
both the [Faroe Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroe_Islands)
and [Greenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland). Bornholm
Island is strategically critical, much closer to Poland than Copenhagen
it was occupied by the Soviets in 1945 and is governed by an agreement
with the Soviet Union which stipulates that no foreign troops will be
stationed there.

The military forces of Denmark are relatively small but very integrated
with the NATO force structure**.**
