The Kingdom of Denmark is one of the original 12 NATO signatories and
relies heavily on collective defence for its survival in conflict.
Geographically small with a population of 5.2 million, Denmark has
Trans-Atlantic responsibilities as it administers both the Faroe Islands
and Greenland. Bornholm Island is strategically critical, much closer to
Poland than Copenhagen it was occupied by the Soviets in 1945 and is
governed by an agreement with the Soviet Union which stipulates that no
foreign troops will be stationed there.

The military forces of Denmark are relatively small but very integrated
with the NATO force structure**.**
