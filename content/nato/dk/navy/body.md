**Denmark Navy**

Although the Danish Navy’s main focus in wartime is plugging the exit
from the Baltic Sea into the Atlantic through the Skagerrak, its
overseas responsibilities for Greenland and the Faroes islands demand an
ocean going element to the navy. Thus Denmark needs to divide its naval
efforts on two fronts, a far ranging ocean going arm, and a branch
dedicated to operating in restricted coastal waters which will be highly
contested.

[**Niels Juel
class**](http://www.navalhistory.dk/English/TheShips/N/NielsJuel(1980).htm):
are a modern versatile ship which carry an impressive array of sensors
and weapons for a ship of this size. These three ships routinely fulfill
Danish commitments to NATO both in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.

**Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV):**

Although armed, these ships are designed for long duration fisheries and
Coast Guard patrols in the Greenland and Faroes Islands areas. They each
host an unarmed Lynx Mk.80 or 80A helicopter.

**[Beskytteren](http://www.navalhistory.dk/English/TheShips/B/Beskytteren(1976).htm):**
This is a single ship built in the mid-1970s but is still serving (until
2000) augmenting the newer Thetis Class.

[**Thetis
Class**](http://www.navalhistory.dk/English/TheShips/Classes/Thetis_Class(1991).htm):
These four ships are all newly commissioned (between 1991 and 1993) and
have excellent modern sensors and communications capabilities.
Displacing twice as much as the Niels Juel Class but with 30% fewer
crew, they are double hulled to protect against ice damage and can break
through 30 inches of solid ice.

**Light Forces**

In the confined waters of the Baltic approaches, the cut and thrust of
light forces is critical. Using islands and narrow seas to shadow radar
signatures, hide ambushing craft and allowing for quick escape lends
itself to small, fast and powerful craft.

[**Flyvefisken
class**](http://www.navalhistory.dk/English/TheShips/F/Flyvefisken(1989).htm):
This is a modern, configurable class which was a new and novel concept
for most navies. Able to switch from a surveillance vessel, a Mine
Countermeasures ship or a Combat Missile Boat configuration within hours
provides a high degree of flexibility. Built in three ‘Series’ all but
one of the boats are available for Northern Fury, both Series 1 and 2
are completed by January 1994 with the single ship 3<sup>rd</sup> Series
still building.

**Willemoes Class:** A very potent class of missile craft, each equipped
with 8x Harpoon missiles and 2 Torpedo tubes. A lot of firepower for a
24-man crew and able to travel at 38 Knts, this is the perfect type of
close quarters missile boat for use in the restricted waters of the
Baltic approaches.

**Submarines**

The Danish Navy operates two class of submarine, both of German design.
Both designs are small, maneuverable and very well suited to operating
in shallow, congested waters. All Danish submarines were based at
Frederikshaven and two were kept at sea at all times with two more ready
for immediate deployment.

[**Narhvalen Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_205_submarine):
These two modified Type 205 submarines were acquired in 1970, they were
very small and with a crew of only 21 personnel were inexpensive to
operate. A major drawback however, was that their torpedoes were only
suitable for surface targets, and not other submarines, this was
mitigated by operating them in coastal waters where they were supported
by ASW helicopters.

**[Tumleren
class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobben-class_submarine):** These
three boats were purchased (along with a 4<sup>th</sup> used for spare
parts) from Norway in 1989-91. This was the Norwegian Kobben class which
were a customized version of the German Type 205 and designated the Type
207. Although very similar to the Narhvalen Class, they were slightly
larger, had a much better maximum dive depth, better sensors, and were
able to track and target other submarines.
