(Danish Submarines â€“ to be added to the Danish Navy page)

**Submarines**

The Danish Navy operates two class of submarine, both of German design.
Both designs are small, maneuverable and very well suited to operating
in shallow, congested waters. All Danish submarines were based at
Frederikshaven and two were kept at sea at all times with two more ready
for immediate deployment.

[**Narhvalen Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_205_submarine):
These two modified Type 205 submarines were acquired in 1970, they were
very small and with a crew of only 21 personnel, were inexpensive to
operate. They had a major drawback in that their torpedoes were only
suitable for surface targets, and not other submarines, this was
mitigated by operating them in coastal waters where they were supported
by ASW helicopters.

**[Tumleren
class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobben-class_submarine):** These
three boats were purchased (along with a 4<sup>th</sup> used for spare
parts) from Norway in 1989-91. This was the Norwegian Kobben class which
were a customized version of the German Type 205 and designated the Type
207. Although very similar to the Narhvalen Class, they were slightly
larger, had a much better maximum dive depth, better sensors, and were
able to track and target other submarines.
