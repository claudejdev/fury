**USN Attack Submarines (SSN)**

An SSN has many names, at its core it is simply a nuclear powered
general purpose submarine, Americans call them ‘Attack Submarines’, the
Royal Navy knows them as ‘Fleet Submarines’, the Soviets call them
‘Cruisers’ and in many ways they have replaced that traditional
surface class in key roles. It is sometimes easier to classify an SSN by
what it isn’t; it is not able to fire ballistic missiles, this is
reserved for SSBNs; it’s primary weapon is not a missile, that would be
an SSGN (none in US service in 1994); and it is not commonly use as a
research vessel, although testing new equipment is routine. Another
distinction that is mere semantics is the term ‘Hunter Killer’ which, is
a popular phrase but is more properly reserved for small diesel powered
boats classified as SSK. Since the USN doesn’t operate SSKs and its
entire submarine fleet is nuclear powered that distinction is not
useful. In Northern Fury the US Navy has 97 of the 100 attack boats
called for in the Reagan ‘600 ship navy’ plan, but also has retained 12
specialist submarines based on SSN hulls. Two key decisions have been
made specific to the Northern Fury world: 1) Older subs will be
maintained to balance the fleet at 100 Attack boats plus 8-10 specialist
hulls; and 2) The Seawolf class will not be canceled and will build as
planned out to the 29 hulls projected, perhaps beyond. Seawolf will
replace older boats over time and the special mission roles will
transfer to the Flight 1 Los Angelis class.

In many ways the unique derivatives of the fleet submarine, developed
largely in the ‘80s, were not foreseen or even technically feasible when
the Reagan plan was drawn up. Special Forces delivery, communications
eavesdropping and gathering electronic intelligence has always been a
function of submarines but the USN took these activities to a far higher
level than previously envisaged, and these developments are too valuable
to squander. Therefore, although the boats dedicated to these tasks are
capable of acting as attack submarines and are classified as SSN, in
Northern Fury the USN will retain them in excess of the main fleet of
attack boats.

[**Permit
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permit-class_submarine): Five of
the 14 boats in this class are still in service, three of them beyond
their historical life. The remaining hulls were commissioned in the late
1960s and three of them (*Flasher, Greenling* and *Gato*) have a longer
hull, larger sail and were built with a ‘SUBSAFE’ standards based on the
lessons learned from the loss of *USS Thresher*, the original class
lead. *USS Haddock* was built with a larger sail and retrofitted with
many other improvements while *Guardfish* was rebuilt to SUBSAFE
standards. These two boats are slated for retirement later in 1994 when
the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> of the Seawolf class are
commissioned. Even though these boats are approaching 30 years old, they
are still very capable and potent platforms, but are not quiet enough
nor do they have the sonar capabilities to challenge modern Soviet
boats. In secondary roles confronted with most other situations however,
they are still very valuable

[**Sturgeon Class**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ssn-637.htm):
All 28 boats of this class remain in service. Not included in this
number are the nine ‘Long Hull Sturgeon’ boats referred to as the
Archerfish class below, or the two experimental boats which were based
on this class: *USS Narwhal*, still in service and detailed below; and
*Glenard P. Lipscomb* which has been retired. The Sturgeons were longer
improved versions of the Permit class, they also had a larger sail and
more sensors. They had the same four torpedo tubes as the Permit class
but carried more reloads and could fire Harpoon missiles, Tomahawk land
attack or anti-ship missiles, SUBROC anti-submarine missiles or standard
Mk-48 ADCAP torpedoes. A midlife upgrade improved the hull mounted sonar
and added a towed array sonar as well as many other electronics
upgrades.

**[USS Narwal
(SSN 671)](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ssn-671.htm):** The
Narwal was a testbed for an advanced propulsion system designed to
minimize or hide noise from water circulation, a constant requirement in
nuclear power plants. The new design made her the quietest submarine of
her time and proved the system for employment on the forthcoming Los
Angeles and Ohio class boats. More important for the Northern Fury
campaign however was her role in the fleet as a Special Mission
electronic intelligence gathering platform, a task she performs
throughout the campaign. At the start of the campaign she is resident at
her homeport of Charleston South Carolina.

[**Archerfish
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon-class_submarine): The
nine boats of this class are often considered Sturgeon class but have a
lengthened hull to provide more space for accommodation and improved
electronic equipment. The additional space allowed for a much easier
transition to [Special Mission
boats](http://www.hisutton.com/Sturgeon_SSN.html), as all of these hulls
have been repurposed to do. In addition to other factors, USS Batfish
was the trials boat for a super quiet surface coating which was later
included on Los Angeles and other submarine designs. Although their
missions varied and these boats underwent some unique overhauls two main
functions emerged:

  - [Cable Tap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ivy_Bells):
    [*Parche*](http://www.hisutton.com/USS_Parche.html) in the Pacific
    and *L. Mendel Rivers* in the Atlantic were extended by 100’ and
    outfitted for deep water research and recovery using divers and a
    special deployable ‘sled’ to tap underwater communications cables.
    The modifications are all very secret and these comments are highly
    speculative but there is some evidence to support these activities.
    Since Northern Fury is fiction, it is not too big of a leap to
    include these capabilities. There is some doubt if *L. Mendel
    Rivers* was modified, but it was used as a DDS submarine and there
    is a good chance that *Richard B. Russell* was equipped this way,
    but she is on the wrong coast.

  - [DDS](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/docs/990100-drydeck.htm):
    [Dry Deck Shelters](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/dds.htm)
    are installable chambers that allow Special Forces personnel and
    equipment to easily depart from the submarine while submerged. These
    have the capacity to hold an underwater
    ‘[SDV’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAL_Delivery_Vehicle)
    Swimmer Delivery Vehicle and up to 20 divers able to conduct a mass
    summer exit from the
sub.

[**Benjamin Franklin Class
SSN**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ssn-640.htm): These two
former SSBNs were converted into Special Mission SSNs in the early
1990s. Large, quiet and equipped with plenty of space for mission
planning and Special Forces accommodation these boats have twin DDS and
a capacity for about 50-70 Special Forces
personnel.

**[Los Angeles
(Type 688)](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ssn-688.htm):** All 62
of the Los Angeles class are in service for Northern Fury, this is about
two years faster than real life but the assumption is that a somewhat
accelerated program would have been adopted for the last five years of
production. In reality there are at least three distinct sub-classes and
several variations within the production of this series:

  - SSNs 688-718 - Original Los Angeles class – 31 boats

  - SSNs 719-725 + 750 - Have 12 vertical launch tubes (VLS) for the
    Tomahawk cruise missile, and an upgraded reactor core.

  - SSNs 751-773 - The final 23 hulls are referred to as "688I" (for
    improved) with better sonar and under ice capability and the 12 VLS
    tubes

These boats are the workhorses of the Northern Fury campaign, they are
quiet, powerful and have excellent sensors. There were several
controversies involved in the design, such as sacrificing dive depth for
higher speed, however no clear unclassified understanding of the real
measurements exists so a general statement that these are fast and
capable boats with very few rivals will have to
suffice.

**[Seawolf
Class](http://www.military-today.com/navy/seawolf_class.htm):** Arguably
the most advanced submarine on the planet, the Seawolf class. Know as
the fastest submarine in the US fleet and the quietest submarine in the
world, estimated at 10 times quitter than an Improved Los Angeles boat,
with twice as many torpedo tubes. Sensors, electronic countermeasures,
accommodation, weapon storage and essentially all other systems are a
major improvement over the 688 class. With this improvement comes a high
cost, these were projected as being the most expensive submarines ever
built, at about $3 Billion dollars each they were three times the price
of a 688 boat as well. Historically the program was cancelled after the
first three were built and there were significant delays caused by
funding shortfalls. In Northern Fury the first two are already in
service while the next two are launched and fitting out for
commissioning later in the year. The plan to build all 29 is being
carried forward and there is discussion of even more. Note that the
3<sup>rd</sup> of the class *USS Jimmy Carter* was completed as an SSN
and not as the redesigned as a Special Mission boat as she was
historically. The Virginia class was not designed or
constructed.
