**USN Attack Submarines (SSN)**

An SSN at its core it is simply a nuclear powered general purpose
submarine, they many names; Americans call them ‘Attack Submarines’, the
Royal Navy knows them as ‘Fleet Submarines’, the Soviets call them
‘Cruisers’ and in many ways they have replaced that traditional surface
class in key roles. It is sometimes easier to classify an SSN by what it
isn’t; it is not able to fire ballistic missiles, this is reserved for
SSBNs; it’s primary weapon is not a missile, that would be an SSGN (none
in US service in 1994); and it is not commonly used as a research
vessel, although testing new equipment is routine. Another distinction
that is mere semantics is the term ‘Hunter Killer’ which, is a popular
phrase but more properly reserved for small diesel powered boats
classified as SSK. Since the USN doesn’t operate SSKs and its entire
submarine fleet is nuclear powered that distinction is not useful. In
Northern Fury the US Navy has 97 of the 100 attack boats called for in
the Reagan ‘600 ship navy’ plan, but has also retained 12 specialist
submarines based on SSN hulls. Two key decisions have been made specific
to the Northern Fury world: 1) Older subs will be maintained to balance
the fleet at 100 Attack boats plus 8-10 specialist hulls; and 2) The
Seawolf class will not be canceled and will build out to the 29 hulls as
projected, perhaps beyond. Seawolf will replace older boats over time
and the special mission roles will transfer to the older Los Angelis
class.

In many ways the unique derivatives of the fleet submarine; Special
Forces delivery, communications eavesdropping and gathering electronic
intelligence have always been a function of submarines, but the USN
developed these activities to a far higher level in the ‘80s. The
capabilities were not foreseen or even technically feasible when the
Reagan plan was drawn up, but were too valuable to squander. Therefore,
although the boats dedicated to these tasks are capable of acting as
attack submarines and are classified as SSN, in Northern Fury the USN
will retain them in excess of the main fleet of attack boats.

[**Permit
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permit-class_submarine): Five of
the 14 boats in this class are still in service, three of them beyond
their historic life. These boats were commissioned in the late 1960s and
three of them (*Flasher, Greenling* and *Gato*) called ‘Style 3’ have a
longer hull, larger sail and were built with a ‘SUBSAFE’ standards based
on the lessons learned from the loss of *USS Thresher*, the original
class lead. *USS Haddock* was built with a larger sail and retrofitted
with many other improvements (Style 2) while *Guardfish* is a ‘Style 1’
hull rebuilt to SUBSAFE standards. *Haddock* and *Guardfish* are slated
for retirement later in 1994 when the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>
of the Seawolf class are commissioned. Even though these boats are
approaching 30 years old, they’re still very capable and potent
platforms but, are not quiet enough nor do they have the sonar
capabilities to challenge modern Soviet boats. In secondary roles
confronted with most other situations however, they are still very
valuable /assets. It’s worth noting that the only ‘Style 4’ boat, *USS
Jack* was older than the five remaining boats and was used as an
experimental testbed with a direct drive, twin screw propulsion system,
she was retired in 1990.

[**Sturgeon Class**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ssn-637.htm):
All 28 boats of this class remain in service. Not included in this
number are the nine ‘Long Hull Sturgeon’ boats referred to as the
Archerfish class below, or the two experimental boats which were based
on this class: *USS Narwhal*, still in service and detailed below; and
*Glenard P. Lipscomb* which has been retired. The Sturgeons were longer,
much improved versions of the Permit class, they had a larger sail, more
weapons and more sensors. Although the Sturgeons had the same four
torpedo tubes as the Permit class but carried more reloads and could
fire Harpoon Anti-Ship Missiles (ASM), Tomahawk land attack or anti-ship
missiles (TLAM), SUBROC anti-submarine missiles or standard Mk-48 ADCAP
torpedoes. A midlife upgrade improved the hull mounted sonar and added a
towed array sonar as well as many other electronics upgrades.
Historically this class started to retire in 1991 while some continued
to serve until 2000, many with less than 30 years service; in Northern
Fury an optimal life of 30 years will be aimed for and they will start
to retire in 1997 as more Seawolf come online.

**[USS Narwal (SSN
671)](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ssn-671.htm):** The Narwal
was a testbed for an advanced propulsion system designed to minimize or
hide noise from water circulation, a constant requirement in nuclear
power plants. The new design made her the quietest submarine of her time
and proved the system for employment on the forthcoming Los Angeles and
Ohio class boats. More important for the Northern Fury campaign however,
was her role in the fleet as a Special Mission electronic intelligence
gathering platform, a task she performs throughout the campaign. At the
start of the war she is resident at her homeport of Charleston South
Carolina, but will spend most of her time lurking along the edge of the
polar icecap collecting intelligence and playing hide & seek with Soviet
patrols.

[**Archerfish
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon-class_submarine): The
nine boats of this sub-class were a version of the Sturgeon and are
often still named for the original design, but have a lengthened hull to
provide more space for accommodation and improved electronic equipment.
Over time the additional space allowed for a much easier transition to
[Special Mission boats](http://www.hisutton.com/Sturgeon_SSN.html), as
all of these hulls have been repurposed to do. The most unique was *USS
Batfish* which became a trials boat for a super quiet surface coating
which was later included on Los Angeles and other submarine designs, she
was also used for other purposes. Although the remaining boats were used
for several missions, and they underwent some unique overhauls, two main
functions emerged:

-   [Cable Tap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ivy_Bells):
    [*Parche*](http://www.hisutton.com/USS_Parche.html) in the Pacific
    and *L. Mendel Rivers* in the Atlantic were extended by 100 feet,
    and outfitted for deep water research and recovery using [saturation
    divers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_diving#Compression)
    and a special deployable ‘sled’ to tap underwater communications
    cables. The modifications are all very secret and these comments are
    highly speculative but there is some evidence to support these
    activities. Since Northern Fury is fiction, it is not too big of a
    leap to include these capabilities. There is some doubt if *L.
    Mendel Rivers* was modified, but it was certainly used as a DDS
    submarine and there is a good chance that *Richard B. Russell* was
    equipped this way, but she is on the wrong coast for our story.

-   [DDS](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/docs/990100-drydeck.htm):
    [Dry Deck Shelters](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/dds.htm)
    are installable chambers that allow Special Forces personnel and
    equipment to easily depart from the submarine while submerged. These
    have the capacity to hold an underwater
    ‘[SDV’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAL_Delivery_Vehicle) Swimmer
    Delivery Vehicle and up to 20 divers able to conduct a mass swimmer
    exit from the sub.

planning and Special Forces accommodation these boats have twin DDS and
a capacity for about 50-70 Special Forces personnel.

**[Los Angeles (Type
688)](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ssn-688.htm):** All 62 of the
Los Angeles or ‘688’ class are in service for Northern Fury, this is
about two years faster than real life but the assumption is that a
somewhat accelerated program would have been adopted for the last five
years of production. There are at least three distinct sub-classes and
several variations within the production of this series:

-   SSNs 688-718 - Original Los Angeles class – 31 boats, usually called
    ‘Flight I’.

-   SSNs 719-725 and 750 - Have 12 vertical launch tubes (VLS) for the
    Tomahawk cruise missile, and an upgraded reactor core. Called
    ‘Flight II’ or Providence Class.

-   SSNs 751-773 - The final 23 hulls are referred to as "688I" (for
    improved) with better sonar and under ice capability and the 12 VLS
    tubes. These are the ‘Flight III’ or San Juan Class.

There were several controversies involved in the design, such as
sacrificing dive depth for higher speed; however, no clear unclassified
understanding of the real measurements exists so a general statement
that these are fast and capable boats with very few rivals will have to
suffice. In Northern Fury, these boats are the workhorses of the
campaign, they are only rivalled by the very latest Soviet boats and
certainly the Flight III sub-class far outmatches even these.

**[Seawolf
Class](http://www.military-today.com/navy/seawolf_class.htm):** Arguably
the most advanced submarine on the planet. The Seawolf class is known as
the fastest submarine in the US fleet and the quietest submarine in the
world, estimated at 10 times quitter than an Improved Los Angeles boat,
with twice as many torpedo tubes. Sensors, electronic countermeasures,
accommodation, weapon storage and essentially all other systems are a
major improvement over the 688 class. With this improvement comes a high
cost, these were projected as being the most expensive submarines ever
built, at about $3 Billion dollars each they were three times the price
of a 688 boat as well. Historically the program was cancelled after the
first three were built and there were significant delays caused by
funding shortfalls. In Northern Fury the first two are already in
service while the next two are launched and fitting out for
commissioning later in the year. The plan to build all 29 is being
carried forward and there is discussion of even more. Note that the
3<sup>rd</sup> of the class *USS Jimmy Carter* was completed as an SSN
and not as the redesigned as a Special Mission boat as she was
historically. The Virginia class was not designed or constructed.
