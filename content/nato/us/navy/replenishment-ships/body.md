**USN Replenishment Ships**

One of the stellar strengths of the USN is the ability to rapidly deploy
globally with significant force and maintain that force for an
indefinite period of time. The only way to do this is with a very
capable network of support ships or facilities abroad that allows the
combat ships to do their job. Prior to, but especially during World War
Two, the USN perfected the techniques required for replenishing ships at
sea (RAS), and this capability has been maintained with some highly
specialized ships. RAS is a fundamental part of the USN’s ability to
operate.

A full list of hull classifications can be found
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hull_classifications), but
a few of the basics will help understand this function:

A= An Auxiliary ship (all ships in this category)

T= Indicates a civilian crew and prefixes the ship type. These are not
generally designed to enter combat zones. These ships usually have the
prefix USNS (United States Naval Ship) as they are not commissioned into
the USN where they would carry the prefix USS (United States Ship).

O= An Oiler, or a fuel replenishment ships which could contain Bunker C,
Diesel or Gas for Gas turbines

E= Ammunition replenishment

F= Refrigerated

R= Repair (although there is an exception noted below)

S= General stores (wide range of supply from rations to spare parts)

**So**:

AE= Ammunition replenishment Auxiliary

AR= Auxiliary Repair ship (has workshops, cranes etc to conduct repairs)
not usually underway

T-AO= An Oiler with a civilian crew

AOE= Combat replenishment Auxiliary because it provides both fuel and
ammunition

AFS= Refrigerated Stores Auxiliary so this would primarily provide
rations

AOR= Replenishment Oiler which is the exception to R=repair

The Ideal method of employing these ships is that a Fast Combat
Replenishment Ship (AOE) accompanies each Aircraft Carrier Battle Group
(CVBG). This ship will keep the carrier full of aircraft ammunition and
aviation fuel, the escorts full of fuel, and everyone full on rations
and general stores. Specific spare parts or small and important items
would be flown in. Once every few days detaches and replenishes itself
from a Replenishment Group consisting of an Fleet Oiler (AO), an
ammunition ship (AE) and a supply ship (AFS). Smaller Task Groups (TG)
would maintain the same rhythm but with a smaller Replenishment Oiler
(AOR). There are several problems with this system: 1) Not all Aircraft
Carriers are nuclear powered yet and the conventional ones require a
huge amount of fuel; 2) There just aren’t enough ships, seven AOEs for
10 CVBGs, seven AOR’s for multiple TGs including the Battleships which
are a massive consumer of fuel; 3) A mix of fuel requirements amongst
escorts, including allied ships, causes capacity issues; 4) Bad weather
causes slow downs and limits, sometimes eliminating RAS completely; 5)
Surge operations draw down stocks rapidly; and 6) Civilian crews are a
consideration in high risk areas.

**AOE: Fast Combat Replenishment Ships**: The USN operates two classes
of these very high end ships, four *Sacramento Class* and three new
*Supply Class*.

**[Supply Class](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/aoe-6.htm):
**

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/replenishment-ships/image2.jpeg)Historically,
*USS Supply* was commissioned in Feb 94 and two of her sisters *USNS
Rainier* and *USNS Arctic* followed in 95, in Northern Fury all were
started on time and without Congressional budgeting issues resulting in
these three being commissioned into the USN prior to Feb 94, with three
more in the class still building (AOE-9 not canceled, AOE-11 ordered).
The Supply Class is an extremely capable and efficient ship which can
maintain high speeds with minimal crew over long distances.

**[Sacramento Class](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/aoe-1.htm):**

This class of ship modernized the methods of RAS used by the USN. By
being able to supply fuel, ammunition and rations plus other stores,
these ships reduced the time and vulnerability of conducting this task,
as well as the number of ships required in high risk
areas.

**[AOR: Replenishment
Oiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita-class_replenishment_oiler):**
The Wichita Class is the only example of the AOR in USN service,
although the type is widely used throughout NATO. Smaller, slower and
less versatile than the AOEs, this class remains important because of
the shortage of the bigger ships. One major issue is that they do not
carry ammunition so to restock a CVBG they would need to be accompanied
by an AE. The first two of these ships were due to decommission but have
been held on duty until more of the Supply class come on
line.

**AO: Fleet Oilers**: There are Five classes of Fleet oilers in service,
the remaining Ashtabula Class, the Mispillion Class and, the Neosho
Class which has been placed into reserve, the Henry J. Kaiser class
which is just coming into service and the Cimarron Class which has been
‘Jumboized’ and now carry ammunition as a stop-gap to the shortage of
AOEs.

[**Cimarron
Class:**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ao-177.htm)

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/replenishment-ships/image5.jpg)Initially
built as Fleet Oilers, all five of these ships went through a process
where they were cut in half and had 108 ft added to their length,
increasing their capacity by 50% and adding the capacity for 650 tons of
ordnance and 420 tons of refrigerated and dry cargo. The added capacity
allows them to act as AOEs but are limited to 20knts so they have
difficulty keeping up with fast moving
CVBGs.

[**Henry J. Kaiser
Class**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/tao-187.htm):

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/replenishment-ships/image6.jpg)A
class of 18 Fleet Oilers designed to replace both the Mispillion and
Neosho Classes which were nearing the end of their useful life. These
ships were designed for civilian crews an were not to military
specifications, as such they are not meant to serve in high threat
environments. The construction program for this class is convoluted and
contentious. Suffice to say, that in the Northern Fury world, all 18
were or would soon be completed and that the completion time was closer
to the four years of the earlier ships than the seven years some
historically took to complete (or in two cases be scrapped at 85-95%
completion\!).

These ships carry as much fuel as the Supply Class AOE (180000 barrels’
vs 177000 barrels) but very limited dry goods storage and no ordinance.
Most are on independent operations at the start of the war on task to
refuel AOE, AOR or independent ships. No specific home ports are given
as there are no Navy crews.

[**Neosho Class**](http://navy.memorieshop.com/Neosho/Class.html):

Built in the mid 50’s these venerable old ships all saw throughout the
cold war and Viet Nam era. All are currently in mothballs on either the
east or west coast and will take between 10 and 30 days to reactivate.
They carry about the same fuel capacity as the Kaiser Class and once
activated will fill key gaps in the replenishment
system.

These five ships were laid down at the end of World War Two but were
much improved from the previous Ashtabula class. Four still survive in
mothballs, one T-AO-107 Passumpsic was caught in the eruption of Mount
Pinatubo while at Subic Bay Philippines in 1991 and suffered significant
damage to her refueling systems, and was scrapped. The remainder will be
reactivated and join the fleet. Even though they are ‘Jumboized’ they
are still smaller than other AO classes and
slower.

Three of these old ships remain in the reserve fleet, Ashtabula herself
being a World War Two veteran. The other two were build after the war
but have the same design. Similar in size and design to the Mispillion
class they have been ‘Jumboized’ but can only attain 18 knots at best
possible
speed.

**AE: Ammunition Replenishment Ships**: There are two classes of AE, the
Suribachi/Nitro Class and the Kilauea Class. An improved class of five
ships was ordered between 91-94 and is building with the first ship
(AE-36) due to launch in 1995, historical these ships were
canceled.

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/replenishment-ships/image10.jpeg)**[Suribachi/Nitro
Class](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ae-21.htm): **

Sometimes considered two separate classes, the two Suribachi’s and three
slightly larger Nitro’s are nearly identical in appearance and
capability. Able to carry ten times the ammunition load of the AOE’s
these ships are critical in keeping the Carrier Battle Groups in
operation. Although nearing the end of their useful life, all remain in
commission for Northern
Fury.

**[Sirius Class:](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/tafs-8.htm) **

Originally built as Fleet Auxiliaries for the Royal Navy (Lyness Class)
about the same time as the Mars class, these three ships were purchased
by the USN in the early 80’s to augment the increased logistic demands
in the Indian Ocean. They were never commissioned into the USN but were
operated by the Military Sealift Command. They carried two UH-46 Sea
Knight helicopters but are
unarmed.
