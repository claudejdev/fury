**USN Replenishment Ships**

One of the stellar strengths of the USN is the ability to rapidly deploy
globally with significant force and maintain that force for an
indefinite period of time. The only way to do this is with a very
capable network of support ships or facilities abroad that allows the
combat ships to do their job. Prior to, but especially during World War
Two, the USN perfected the techniques required for replenishing of ships
at sea (RAS), and this capability has been maintained with some highly
specialized ships. RAS is a fundamental part of the USN’s ability to
operate.

A full list of hull classifications can be found
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hull_classifications), but
a few of the basics will help understand the functions:

-   A= An Auxiliary ship (all ships in this category)

-   T= Indicates a civilian crew and prefixes the ship type. These are
    not generally designed to enter combat zones. These ships usually
    have the prefix USNS (United States Naval Ship) as they are not
    commissioned into the USN where they would carry the prefix USS
    (United States Ship). A similar arrangement exists for the UK’s
    Royal Navy’s with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Ships (RFA).

-   O= An Oiler, or a fuel replenishment ships which could contain
    Bunker C oil, Diesel fuel, or Gas for Gas turbines.

-   E= Ammunition replenishment

-   F= Refrigerated

-   R= Repair (although there is an exception noted below)

-   S= General stores (wide range of supply from rations to spare parts)

So since they are all auxiliaries and some combine multiple functions in
one ship, an example of the classifications become:

-   AE= Ammunition replenishment Auxiliary;

-   AR= Auxiliary Repair ship (has workshops, cranes etc to conduct
    repairs) not usually underway;

-   T-AO= An Oiler with a civilian crew;

-   AOE= Combat replenishment Auxiliary because it provides both fuel
    and ammunition;

-   AFS= Refrigerated Stores Auxiliary so this would primarily provide
    rations;

-   AOR= Replenishment Oiler, this is the exception to using ‘R’
    normally used for ‘repair’. These ships are able to carry some dry
    goods, and some refrigerated goods in addition to fuel.

The Ideal method of employing these ships is that a Fast Combat
Replenishment Ship (AOE) accompanies each Aircraft Carrier Battle Group
(CVBG). This ship will keep the carrier full of aircraft ammunition and
aviation fuel, the escorts full of fuel, and everyone full on rations
and general stores. Once every few days the AOE detaches and replenishes
itself from a Replenishment Group consisting of an Fleet Oiler (AO), an
ammunition ship (AE) and a supply ship (AFS). Specific spare parts or
small and important items would be flown in. Smaller Task Groups (TG)
would maintain the same rhythm but with a smaller Replenishment Oiler
(AOR). There are several problems with this system:

1.  Not all Aircraft Carriers are nuclear powered by 1994 and the
    conventional powered carriers require a huge amount of fuel;

2.  There just aren’t enough ships; seven AOEs for 10 CVBGs, seven AOR’s
    for multiple TGs including the Battleships which are a massive
    consumer of fuel;

3.  A mix of fuel requirements amongst escorts, including allied ships,
    causes capacity issues;

4.  Bad weather causes slow downs and limits RAS operations;

5.  Surge operations draw down stocks rapidly; and

6.  Ships with civilian crews are limited in their ability to sail in
    high risk areas.

**AOE: Fast Combat Replenishment Ships**: The USN operates two classes
of these very high end ships, four *Sacramento Class* and three new
*Supply Class*.

**[Supply Class](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/aoe-6.htm):**
Historically, *USS Supply* was commissioned in Feb 94 and two of her
sisters *USNS Rainier* and *USNS Arctic* followed in 95; in Northern
Fury all were started on time and without Congressional budgeting
issues, resulting in these three being commissioned into the USN prior
to Feb 94. Three more in the class are still building (AOE-9 not
canceled, AOE-11 ordered). The Supply Class is an extremely capable and
efficient able to maintain high speeds with minimal crew over long
distances.

**[Sacramento Class](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/aoe-1.htm):**
This class of ship modernized the methods of RAS used by the USN. By
being able to supply fuel, ammunition and rations plus other stores,
these ships reduced the time and vulnerability of conducting this task,
as well as the number of ships required in high risk areas.

**[AOR: Replenishment
Oiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita-class_replenishment_oiler):**
The Wichita Class is the only example of the AOR in USN service,
although the type is widely used throughout NATO. Smaller, slower and
less versatile than the AOEs, this class remains important because of a
shortage of the bigger ships. One major issue is that they do not carry
ammunition, so to restock a CVBG they would need to be accompanied by an
AE. The first two of these ships were due to decommission but have been
held on duty in Northern Fury until more of the Supply class come on
line.

**AO: Fleet Oilers**: There are Five classes of Fleet oilers in service,
the remaining Ashtabula Class, the Mispillion Class and, the Neosho
Class which has been placed into reserve, the Henry J. Kaiser class
which is just coming into service and the Cimarron Class which has been
‘Jumboized’ and now carries ammunition as a stop-gap to the shortage of
AOEs.

[**Cimarron Class:**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ao-177.htm)
Initially built as Fleet Oilers, all five of these ships went through a
process where they were cut in half and had 108 feet added to their
length, increasing fuel capacity by 50%, and adding the capability to
carry and deliver 650 tons of ordnance and 420 tons of refrigerated and
dry cargo. The added capacity allows them to act as AOEs but they’re
limited to 20knts, so have difficulty keeping up with fast moving CVBGs.

[**Henry J. Kaiser
Class**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/tao-187.htm): A class of
18 Fleet Oilers designed to replace both the Mispillion and Neosho
Classes which are nearing the end of their useful life. These ships were
designed for civilian crews and were not built to military
specifications, as such they are not meant to serve in high threat
environments. The historic construction program for this class was
convoluted and contentious. Suffice to say, that in the Northern Fury
world, all 18 were, or would soon be completed, and that the completion
time was closer to the four years of the earlier ships than the seven
years some actually took to complete (or in two cases be scrapped at
85-95% completion!).

These ships carry as much fuel as the Supply Class AOE (180000 barrels’
vs 177000 barrels) but very limited dry goods storage and no ordinance.
Most are on independent operations at the start of the war on task to
refuel AOE, AOR or independent ships. No specific home ports are given
as there are no Navy crews.

[**Neosho Class**](http://navy.memorieshop.com/Neosho/Class.html): Built
in the mid 50’s these venerable old ships all saw plenty of use
throughout the cold war and Viet Nam era. All are currently in reserve
on either the east or west coast and will take between 10 and 30 days to
reactivate. They carry about the same fuel capacity as the Kaiser Class
and once activated will fill key gaps in the replenishment system.

[**Mispillion Class**](http://www.shipscribe.com/usnaux/AO/AO105.html):
These five ships were laid down at the end of World War Two but were
much improved from the previous Ashtabula class. Four still survive in
reserve, one T-AO-107 Passumpsic was caught in the eruption of Mount
Pinatubo while at Subic Bay Philippines in 1991 and suffered significant
damage to her refueling systems, and was scrapped. The remainder will be
reactivated and join the fleet. Even though they are ‘Jumboized’ they
are still smaller than other AO classes and slower.

[**Ashtabula Class**](http://www.shipscribe.com/usnaux/AO/AO51.html):
Three of these old ships remain in the reserve fleet, Ashtabula herself
being a World War Two veteran. The other two were build after the war
but have the same design. Similar in size and design to the Mispillion
class they have been ‘Jumboized’ but can only attain 18 knots at best
possible speed.

**AE: Ammunition Replenishment Ships**: There are two classes of AE, the
Suribachi/Nitro Class and the Kilauea Class. An improved class of five
ships was ordered between 91-94 and is building with the first ship
(AE-36) due to launch in 1995, historically these ships were canceled.

**[Suribachi/Nitro
Class](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ae-21.htm):** Sometimes
considered two separate classes, the two Suribachi’s and three slightly
larger Nitro’s are nearly identical in appearance and capability. Able
to carry ten times the ammunition load of the AOE’s these ships are
critical in keeping the Carrier Battle Groups in operation. Although
nearing the end of their useful life, all remain in commission for
Northern Fury.

**[Kilauea Class](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/tae-26.htm):**
The lead ship of this class was transferred to the Military Sea Lift

**[Sirius Class:](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/tafs-8.htm)**
Originally built as Fleet Auxiliaries for the Royal Navy (Lyness Class)
about the same time as the Mars class, these three ships were purchased
by the USN in the early 80’s to augment the increased logistic demands
for operating in the Indian Ocean. They were never commissioned into the
USN but were operated by the Military Sealift Command. They carried two
UH-46 Sea Knight helicopters but are unarmed.
