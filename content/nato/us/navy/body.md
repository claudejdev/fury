**USN**

The United States Navy has been the undisputed naval powerhouse since
the Second World War. Not only is it the only Navy to have global reach
and power projection with multiple Supper Carriers, but its submarine
fleet is arguably unrivalled, except perhaps but the USSR.

Battle Group Z during the Persian Gulf War

Historically the USN reached its late Cold War zenith in 1987 while in
the midst of building up to a 600 Ship Navy, with the warming of
relations between East and West, congress started to reduce funding of
new ships and demand retirement of older ships. In Northern Fury
however, this warming of relations did not happen and the 600 Ship Navy
remained an extant strategy. However, reality and budgets do limit
aspirations.

The rational for the 600 ship Navy can be found in the [US Congressional
Report](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/99th-congress-1985-1986/reports/1985_09_futurebudgetrequirements.pdf)
from Sept 1985 and this
[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/600-ship_Navy) gives a good summary
of the original plan. The chart from page 25 of the Congressional Report
is reprinted here:

Historically the 600 ship Navy policy was in rapid decline by the early
‘90s, but in Northern Fury it remains extant with most goals having
been achieved by 1994. Some of the key areas where Northern Fury strays
from the historic are:

  - The aircraft carrier (CV) USS Ranger (CV-61) was not decommissioned
    but instead, held in San Diego with reduced crew and no air group as
    ready reserve. She will be retired when USS John C. Stennis (CGN-74)
    is commissioned later in 1994 or possibly later.

  - The USS Forrestal (CV-59) was retained as an air group training
    carrier.

  - USS Enterprise (CVN-65) completed an accelerated overhaul 8 months
    early.

  - All of the Iowa class battleships (BBs) were retained in service

  - All nuclear powered guided missile cruisers (CGN) were retained.
    This represents a total of nine ships: 4 x Virginia class, 2 x
    California class, and the Long Beach, Bainbridge & Truxton.

  - All Belknap & Leahy class CGs were retained (nine of each) with the
    NTU (New Threat Upgrades) complete. Combined, the additional 27
    CG/CGNs means that a third CG/CGN can deploy with most Carrier
    Battle Groups (CVBG) as well as act as Flag for smaller Task Groups
    (TG).

  - Four of 29 Seawolf Class fleet attack submarines (SSN) have been
    launched with two commissioned, another 3-5 will be complete by the
    end of 1995. The Virginia Class has not been designed or considered
    as it was built as a stop gap when the Seawolf class was canceled.
    Of all measures taken, this was the most controversial due to the
    cost of the Seawolf, and the proposals for the Virginia class are
    quite promising.

  - 28 Sturgeon class plus the 9 long hull (Archerfish) Class, the
    Narwhal and 3x Permit class SSNs were retained. The Permit’s
    followed by the Sturgeons will decommission as the Seawolf class
    comes on line. A stable fleet size of 100 fleet attack boats and
    9-10 special mission boats will be maintained.

  - Seven Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers (DDG), called
    the DDG-51 class have been completed with 5-6 per year planned to
    culminate at 62 units.

  - Because of the urgent need for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) escorts,
    the shortage of dry-dock space and the increased number of Tomahawk
    Land Attack Missile (TLAM) carrying ships; the last 7 of 31 Spruance
    class destroyers (DD) will not be upgraded to carry the Vertical
    Launch Missile System (VLS) but will remain ASW DDs and undergo
    shorter mid-life refits than the other 24 ships. The 4 Kidd Class
    DDGs received their NTU in the late 80’s and will serve another 20
    years.

  - The Farragut Class DDGs have been retained, 6x NTU refits have been
    completed, all based on the East Coast, with the remaining four
    completing later in 1994.

  - Only three Charles F. Adams NTU DDGs are ready but another 12 are
    undergoing refit which will be completed in the next 18 months. Both
    of the older DDG classes (Farragut and Charles F. Adams) will serve
    until \~2000 when enough of the Arleigh Burke’s are available to
    relieve them.

  - The 51 unit Oliver Hazard Perry (OHP) Class Guided Missile Frigates
    (FFG) completed commissioning in 89 with no replacement on the
    horizon. The Navy pointed out this gap to Congress and a further 12
    were ordered in 91 with the first four already launched and due to
    commission later in 1994. As a stop-gap four Brooke Class FFG’s
    (FFG-3-6) were retained, but will decommission later this year. A
    ‘Follow on Frigate’ program is underway with a bid for 72 units,
    the first being laid down in early 95 and will replace both the OHP
    and the Knox Class in the escort role. The OHP will average 30 years
    of service when decommissioned.

  - 36 of the 46 ship Knox class Frigates (FF) remain in service, the
    remaining 10 are in ready reserve and can activate within 30 days.
    The problem plagued design will be replaced by the ‘Follow on
    Frigate’ program with Knox class ship retiring on a 2 for 1 basis
    starting in 1996. The result will be that most will be in service
    for 25-27 years. (Historic real life service was only 23 years).
