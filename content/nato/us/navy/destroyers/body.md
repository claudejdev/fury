**USN DD/DDG’s**

In Northern Fury the US Navy fields 67 Destroyers (DD) and Guided
Missile Destroyers (DDG), 29 more than historically accurate, but this
number is deceptive. Of these, 25 represents ships not retired and 16 of
these older ships are undergoing refit at the start of the Northern Fury
campaign.  The remaining increase are 4 Arleigh Burk class ships being
commissioned 6-8 months early.  Therefore, the substantive increase at
the start of Northern Fury is 13 Destroyers. The decision to maintain
the older ships was a contentious one, many would rather they be
scrapped and put the maintenance and overall time and money into more
new ships, and the personnel cost of manning the ships could be better
spent on training. However, in a series of rapid fire rulings by
Congress, keeping the older ships was cheaper and quicker than building
new, so the navy planners got to work, glad that the short sighted
‘peace dividend’ mania that swept through the west in the post Cold
War days was behind them.

**Class**](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/charlesfadamsclass/): The
23 ships of this class were commissioned in the early 1960s, and served
a long and useful life as ASW escort ships with a decent Anti Air
Warfare (AAW) capability. Although upgraded over time to carry the
RIM-66 Standard SAM with better sensors, the main drawback of these
ships was the lack of a helicopter. Historically only 3 of this class
received a complete New Threat Upgrade (NTU) but in Northern Fury 12
more of the class will complete this upgrade in the next 18 months. The
other 8 ships have been scrapped, sunk or sold as they were in real
life. These ships are useful in secondary roles and would have great
difficulty in a high threat
area.

[**Farragut
Class**](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/farragutclass/): The 10
ships of this class were all launched between 1959-61 as AAW ships to
protect the fact aircraft carrier battel groups (CVBG). These ships have
a dual arm Mk 10 SAM launcher and with the NTU were able to fire medium
range Standard missiles and 8 Harpoon SSMs. Historically only USS Mahan
(**DDG-42**) received the complete NTU improvement but in Northern Fury
all ships of this class were retained and refit. To date 6 have
completed the NTU upgrade and the remaining 4 ships will complete their
upgrade later in
1994.

**[Kidd Class](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/kiddclass/):** The 4
Kidd Class DDGs, based on the Spruance design, were originally destined
for Iran as part of a 6 ship transfer which was canceled when the Shah
was deposed by a hard line anti-US government. These 4 were completed
and delivered to the USN in 1981-82. The ships took an excellent design
from the Spruance and made it better (and heavier) by adding missile
launchers capable of firing both SAMs and ASROC ASW torpedoes. In the
late ‘80s the Kidds’ received their NTU greatly enhancing their AAW
capabilities and will serve another 20 years as they did
historically.

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/destroyers/image4.jpg)[**Spruance
Class:**](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/spruanceclass/) These
ships were designed from the ground up to defeat the latest Soviet
submarines and defend US CVBGs. This meant that they were big and fast
ships, able to keep pace with a nuclear powered aircraft carrier in
heavy seas. Because of their size they were easily modified throughout
their life as the threat changed or technology became available. All 31
ships carry 2 SH-60B Seahawk ASW helicopters. 24 of the 31 ship class
had a major upgrade adding a 61-cell Vertical Launch Missile System
(VLS), and 10 of these also received a 21 cell Rolling Airframe Missile
(**RAM**) system. However, as the threat evolved and there was an urgent
need for ASW escorts and a shortage of dry-dock space (needed to refit
older ships) the last 7 ships will not be upgraded to carry the VLS but
will remain ASW DDs and undergo shorter mid-life refits than the other
24
ships.

[**Arleigh Burke
Class:**](http://destroyerhistory.org/arleighburkeclass/) This is a very
advanced class of ship, which as history has shown will grow to a class
of 82 ships and replace all other escort types in the USN. In 1994
however, the situation is quite different and seven of this class have
been completed, 4 more than historically.  There will be an additional 6
commissioned in late 94 or early 95. All of these ships are ‘Flight 1’.
This class has a 90-cell VLS system able to fire any missile in the US
inventory, making they very configurable, changing the missile load as
the task changes. The major disadvantage of the Flight 1 ships is the
lack of a hanger, so their ASW capability is negatively impacted if they
are working
alone.
