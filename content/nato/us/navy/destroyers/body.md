**USN DD/DDG**

In Northern Fury the US Navy fields 67 Destroyers (DD) and Guided
Missile Destroyers (DDG), 29 more than they historically did, but this
number is deceptive. Of these, 25 represents ships not retired and 16 of
these older ships are undergoing refit at the start of the Northern Fury
campaign.  The remaining increase are 4 Arleigh Burk class ships being
commissioned 6-8 months early.  Therefore, the substantive increase at
the start of Northern Fury is 13 Destroyers. The decision to maintain
the older ships was a contentious one, many would rather they be
scrapped and put the maintenance and overall time and money into more
new ships, and the personnel cost of manning the ships could be better
spent on training. However, in a series of rapid fire rulings by
Congress, keeping the older ships was cheaper and quicker than building
new, so navy planners got to work, glad that the short sighted ‘peace
dividend’ mania that swept through the west in the post Cold War days
was behind them.

[**Charles F. Adams**
**Class**](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/charlesfadamsclass/): The
23 ships of this class were commissioned in the early 1960s, and served
a long and useful life as ASW escort ships with a decent Anti Air
Warfare (AAW) capability. Although upgraded over time to carry the
RIM-66 Standard SAM with better sensors, the main drawback of these
ships is the lack of a helicopter. Historically only 3 of this class
received a complete New Threat Upgrade (NTU) but in Northern Fury 12
more will complete this upgrade in the next 18 months. These ships are
useful in secondary roles and would have great difficulty in a high
threat area. Eight more Adams class DDGs are in Ready Reserve but will
require a refit before they see service
again.

[**Farragut
Class**](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/farragutclass/): The 10
ships of this class were all launched between 1959-61 as AAW escorts to
protect the fast aircraft carrier battel groups (CVBG). The Farragut
class has a dual arm Mk 10 SAM launcher and with the NTU were able to
fire medium range Standard missiles, the NTU upgrade also adds 8 Harpoon
SSMs. Historically only USS Mahan (**DDG-42**) received the complete NTU
improvement but in Northern Fury all ships of this class were retained
and refit. To date 6 have completed the NTU and the remaining 4 ships
will complete their refit later in
1994.

**[Kidd Class](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/kiddclass/):** The
four Kidd Class DDGs, based on the Spruance design, were originally
destined for Iran as part of a six ship transfer which was canceled when
the Shah was deposed by a hard line anti-US government. These four were
completed and delivered to the USN in 1981-82. The ships took an
excellent design from the Spruance and made it better (and heavier) by
adding missile launchers capable of firing both SAMs and ASROC ASW
torpedoes as well as many other improvements. In the late 1980s the
Kidds’ received their NTU greatly enhancing the AAW capabilities and
will serve another 20 years as they did
historically.

[**Spruance
Class:**](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/spruanceclass/) These
ships were designed from the ground up to defeat the latest Soviet
submarines and defend US CVBGs. This meant that they were big and fast
ships, able to keep pace with a nuclear powered aircraft carrier in
heavy seas. Because of their size they were easily modified throughout
their life as threats changed or technology became available. All 31
ships carry two SH-60B Seahawk ASW helicopters and 24 of the 31 ships in
the class had a major upgrade adding a 61-cell Vertical Launch Missile
System (VLS). Ten of the VLS ships also received a 21 cell Rolling
Airframe Missile (**RAM**) system. However, as the threat evolved once
again and there was an urgent need for ASW escorts and a shortage of
dry-dock space (needed to refit older ships) the last seven ships will
not be upgraded to carry the VLS but will remain ASW DDs and undergo
shorter mid-life refits than the
others.

[**Arleigh Burke

advanced class of ship. History has shown that this class will grow to
of 82 ships and replace all other escort types in the USN, and possibly
the Cruisers as well by the 2020s. In 1994 however, the future is
unclear but the need for ships is urgent; therefore, seven, vice the
three historically have been completed.  There will be an additional 6
commissioned in late 94 or early 95. Known as the DDG-51 Class, all of
the ships in service in Northern Fury are ‘Flight 1’ with the major
disadvantage of lacking a hanger; so their ASW capability is negatively
impacted if they are working alone. This class has a 90-cell VLS system
able to fire any missile in the US inventory, making they very flexible,
configuring the missile load as the task
changes.
