**USMC Air Element**

The US Marine Corps has an air Element that would rival most Air Forces
around the world. With over 1300 airframes, half of which are fixed
wing, and the remainder rotary wing, they can bring over 700 combat
aircraft to battle, many more than most NATO allies or non-Soviet WP
adversaries. All but the F/A-18s normally deploy on the various
amphibious ships to form the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTAF) in
direct support of the ground element in any landing or operation. The
Squadrons are highly flexible often deploying on multiple ships or
employing aircraft of other squadrons on independent missions.

**F/A-18** Hornet. The F/A-18’s provide the USMC with an air attack
capability as well as the option to conduct air superiority missions,
although that is not their primary role. Hornets will normally operate
from a land base but are often flown off of USN aircraft carriers, and
routinely form part of a Carrier Air Wing (CAW). The USMC uses three
types of the F/A-18, the ‘A’ variant in its VMFA Squadrons (Marine
Fighter Attack) and the ‘D’ variant in its VMFA(AW) (Marine Fighter
Attack – All Weather Capable), some newer F/A-18C(N) are starting to
flow into the squadrons providing a single seat aircraft with night
precision attack capability. The only major variation from history is
that in Northern Fury all USMC Reserve Squadrons will receive the
F/A-18A, these are ‘hand-me-downs’ from the USN which are all
transitioning to the ‘C’ variant early after the demise of the A-6E.
With this change in effect, all but one of them have received their
aircraft but five of those are still going through conversion training.
All F/A-18 Sqns have 12 aircraft except VMFAT-101, the training Sqn
which has 30
airframes.

**AV-8B Harrier II/II+**: The USMC is the only service in the US which
uses the Harrier and has done so since 1968. The current version is the
Harrier II+ which will eventually equip six Sqns, however only 4 have
this version at the moment (this is a more rapid transition than
historical). The key improvement between the Harrier II and the II+ is
the provision of the AN/APG-65 Radar allowing the use of the AIM-7
Sparrow and AIM-120 AMRAAM air to air missiles. The Harriers primary
mission is to fly off the LHD/LHA ships in support of Marine ground
units ashore. The TAV variant is a two seat trainer, solely for use in
conversion
training

**EA-6B**: The USMC uses the same Electronic Warfare (EW) aircraft as
the USN. The EA-6B Sqns are mostly located at MCAS Cherry Point NC but
operate detachments around the world when required.

**OV-10D:** Although the OV-10 Bronco was supposed to be retiring in
1995, but there was nothing available to replace them so the increased
tension meant that they were retained. Keeping the Broncos frees up
other resources such as Harriers and USAF A-10s to focus on major threat
areas while the OV-10s look after the low intensity Counter Insurgency
(COIN) conflicts, primarily in Central America. Of the 130 originally
produced for the USMC, 51 remain.

OV-10D Observation and light attack aircraft

**KC-130**: The USMC uses the venerable C-130 Hercules almost
exclusively in the ‘Tanker’ role, light tactical transport is also
conducted but they rely on the USN and USAF to provide surge tactical
transport as required. Pilot and crew training is also conducted with
the USAF, although specific air to air refuelling and currency training
is conducted by VMGRT-253. Because of the deployed nature of USMC forces
there is a need for deployed KC-130 elements throughout the globe to
support Amphibious Ready Groups (ARG) and other elements – this support
is almost always provided by VMGR-252 which usually has between 10 and
20 KC-130s deployed. Three versions of the ‘Hurc’ are in use; legacy
KC-130F which date from the 1960’s, improved KC-130R and the latest
KC-130T with updated
avionics.

**AH-1W**: The ‘Whiskey Cobra’. The Cobra has been key to USMC ground
support since early in the Viet Nam war, the ‘Whiskey’ is the standard
version used in 1994, it is night capable and able to fire either 8x TOW
or Hellfire missiles.

**UH-1N**: Twin Huey. HMLA (Marine Helicopter Light Attack) Sqns are
equipped with both the Whiskey Cobra and the UH-1N Huey. These two
aircraft work together to provide ground support with the Huey
conducting reconnaissance and observation while the Cobra maneuvers to
the best engagement position before exposing itself. In the USMC Reserve
each Sqn is equipped with a single aircraft type but they are grouped
for operations.

AH-1W ‘Whiskey Cobra’ UH-1N ‘Twin Huey’

**CH-46E**: ‘Sea Knight’. Known as ‘Phrogs’ these twin rotor workhorses
are the standard medium lift helicopter in the USMC. They can carry 24
fully loaded Marines with their combat equipment or 2.5 tons of cargo
either internally or slung underneath. Additionally, they are often
configured for Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), or Medical Evacuation
(MEDEVAC) missions where they can carry 15 stretchers. An upgrade
program to extend the range of the ‘Sea Knight’ is ongoing and most
Squadrons have at least 2-4 of these upgraded
‘Phrogs’.

CH-46E from HMM-268 ‘Red Dragons’ picks up a slung load.

**CH-53**: In 1994 the USMC flew both the CH-53D ‘Sea Stallion’ and the
CH-53E ‘Super Stallion’. These aircraft provide heavy lift needed to
deploy Marine ground elements quickly onto the battlefield with the
combat power needed to win the day. The ‘Sea Stallion’ is one of the
fastest helicopters in the world even when carrying a heavy load. The
‘Super Stallion’ in addition to keeping the speed of the earlier model
is one of the largest helicopters in the
world.
