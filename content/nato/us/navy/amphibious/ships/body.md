NATO/US Navy/ Amphibious Forces/Amphibious Ships

**Amphibious ships**

The core capability of the USMC, that of delivering combat power to
contested shores falls on its ships. Once on land the ground and air
elements take over the heavy fighting, but they need to get ashore in a
coherent combat ready fashion to have the effect needed.

The US Navy (USN) has the largest and most modern collection of
amphibious ships on the planet (The Gator Navy). Although not enough of
these ships exist to satisfy the strategic requirement they are still
very impressive. The Gator Navy consists of a multitude of ship types
and capabilities. Some of which are listed here:

**LHD**: [Landing Helicopter
Dock](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lhd-1.htm). These extremely
capable ships of the Wasp Class are the latest and most capable
Amphibious ships in the world. Capable of hosting AV-8B Harriers,
helicopters and having a docking bay for landing craft or the LCAC
(Landing Craft Air Cushioned) or hovercraft, one of these ships is
capable of carrying 1800 Marines and a full Battalions worth of
equipment. At 40,000 tons, these exceptionally flexible ships displace
as much or more then most World War Two Battleships and all war era
aircraft carriers except the IJN Shinano (which only survived a few
days).

Historically only 3 of these ships were commissioned by 1994, however
due to increased tensions in Northern Fury the original schedule was
maintained and there were 2 more commissioned – LHD-5 Bataan joining the
fleet at the end of Jan 1994, only two weeks old at war start. The next
ship of this class to joint the fleet will be in mid 1995.

**LHA**: [Landing Helicopter
Assault](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lha-1.htm). The
predecessors to the Wasp class are the Tarawa Class LHA. These ships,
while almost as capable as the LHD, are 10 years older both in design
and in technology. Each is capable of conducting the same operations but
the LHA has a few more limitations. These are still very fine ships and
among the best in the world. Of the nine ships originally planned only
five were built.

**LPH**: [Landing Platform
Helicopter](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lph-2.htm). The first
dedicated post World War Two large Amphibious Assault ships were the Iwo
Jima Class LPH. Only half the displacement of the Tarawa class, these
ships have the same task of carrying up to 15-1800 Marines, however they
can only carry a small fraction of the cargo, do not have a well deck
and therefore cannot deploy an LCAC and can only host about half the air
group of the larger ships. These ships are approaching retirement age,
having been launched in the 60’s but were maintained in the fleet due to
the heightened threat. The seven ships in this class are not
sequentially numbered.

**LPD**: [Landing Platform
Dock](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lpd-4.htm). There are two
main classes of these ships. The Raleigh class of two ships was due to
retire in the early 90’s but was retained. The Austin class of eleven,
with three sub classes, the Cleveland sub-class (7 ships) with an
additional Flag deck and the Trenton sub-class (2 ships), all are
effectively the same. It is worth noting that one Raleigh class and one
Austin class were modified to be command ships (AGF-3 La Salle, and
AGF-11 Coronado). These ships house about 850 Marines and good amount of
heavy equipment. They are often used to carry heavy loads such as the
tanks with landing craft Mechanized (LCM) to unload them. They are
capable of independent operations.

**LSD**: [Landing Ship
Dock](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lsd-41.htm). Although very
similar in appearance and size to the LPD, the LSD’s primary purpose is
to transport landing craft and LCACs, it only holds half the Marines of
an LPD and much less heavy equipment and cargo. They can house up to 4
LCACs however. Of the three classes, LSD-36 Anchorage (5 ships) is the
smallest, holding 3x LCACs, LSD-41 Whidbey Island (8 ships) can hold 4x
LCAC, while the newest class being rushed into service, LSD-49 Harpers
Ferry can only hold 2x LCACs but 10 times the cargo of the others.

**LST**: [Landing Ship
Tank](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lst-1179.htm). The smallest
of what can be called an amphibious ship in the USN, these specialty
ships are much improved decedents of the famous LSTs that landed on the
beaches of Normandy and virtually every other beach assaulted by the
Allies in World War Two. Able to lay down a ramp to unload over its bow,
and open a loading gate in the stern of the ship, these ships carry up
to 29 tanks and 350 Marines directly to the landing area, land them
directly onto the beach or dock, and can act as a causeway for larger
ships unloading by ramp into the stern and driving through the LST onto
the beach. Unloading by helicopter or crane onto a dock or small boats
is also available.
