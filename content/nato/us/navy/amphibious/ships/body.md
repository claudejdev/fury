**Amphibious ships**

The core capability of an amphibious force, that of delivering combat
power to contested shores falls on its ships. Once on land the ground
and air elements take over the heavy fighting, but they need to get
ashore in a coherent combat ready fashion to have the effect needed.

The US Navy (USN) has the largest and most modern collection of
amphibious ships on the planet (The Gator Navy). Although not enough of
these ships exist to satisfy the strategic requirement, they are very
impressive ships an together form a formidable force. The Gator Navy
consists of a multitude of ship types and capabilities. Some of which
are listed here:

**LHD**: [Landing Helicopter
Dock](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lhd-1.htm). These extremely
capable ships of the Wasp Class are the largest and most capable
Amphibious ships in the world. Capable of hosting AV-8B Harriers,
helicopters and having a docking bay for landing craft or the LCAC
(Landing Craft Air Cushioned) or hovercraft, one of these ships is
capable of carrying 1800 Marines and a full Battalion worth of
equipment. At 40,000 tons, these exceptionally flexible ships displace
as much or more then most World War Two Battleships and all war era
aircraft carriers except the IJN Shinano (which only survived a few
days).

Historically only three of these ships were commissioned by 1994,
however due to increased tensions in Northern Fury the original schedule
was maintained and there were two additional hulls available – LHD-5
Bataan joining the fleet at the end of Jan 1994, only two weeks old at
war start. The next ship of this class to joint the fleet will be in mid
1995.

**LHA**: [Landing Helicopter
Assault](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lha-1.htm). The
predecessors to the Wasp class are the Tarawa Class LHA. These ships,
while almost as capable as the LHD, but are 10 years older both in
design and in technology, each is capable of conducting the same
operations but the LHA has a few more limitations. These are still very
fine ships and among the best in the world. Of the nine ships originally
planned only five were built.

**LPH**: [Landing Platform
Helicopter](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lph-2.htm). The first
dedicated post World War Two large Amphibious Assault ships were the Iwo
Jima Class LPH. Only half the displacement of the Tarawa class, these
ships have the same task of carrying up to 1800 Marines, however they
can only carry a small fraction of the cargo, and do not have a well
deck, therefore cannot deploy an LCAC and can only host about half the
air group of the larger ships. These ships are approaching retirement
age, having been launched in the 60’s but were maintained in the fleet
due to the heightened threat. The seven ships in this class are not
sequentially numbered.

**LPD**: [Landing Platform
Dock](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lpd-4.htm). There are two
main classes of these smaller amphibious ships. The Raleigh class of two
ships was due to retire in the early 90’s but were retained. The Austin
class of eleven, with three sub classes, the Cleveland sub-class (7
ships) with an additional space and communications to be a Flagship and
the Trenton sub-class (2 ships) with updated systems, all are
effectively the same. These ships house about 850 Marines and good
amount of heavy equipment, and are often used to carry heavy loads such
as the tanks with landing craft Mechanized (LCM) to unload them. They
are capable of independent operations and when part of an ARG/ESG will
often be detached to conduct separate duties. It is worth noting that
one Raleigh class and one Austin class were modified to be command ships
(AGF-3 La Salle, and AGF-11 Coronado).

**LSD**: [Landing Ship
Dock](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lsd-41.htm). Although very
similar in appearance and size to the LPD; the LSD’s primary purpose is
to transport landing craft and LCACs, it only holds half the Marines of
an LPD and much less heavy equipment and cargo. An enormous docking bay
enables them to house up to 4 LCACs. Of the three classes in service,
LSD-36 Anchorage (5 ships) is the smallest, holding 3x LCACs, LSD-41
Whidbey Island (8 ships) can hold 4x LCAC, while the newest class being
rushed into service, LSD-49 Harpers Ferry can only hold 2x LCACs but 10
times the cargo of the others.

**LST**: [Landing Ship
Tank](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lst-1179.htm). The smallest
amphibious ship in the USN, these are much improved decedents of the
famous LSTs that landed on the beaches of Normandy and virtually every
other beach assaulted by the Allies in World War Two. These ships carry
up to 29 tanks and 350 Marines, they’re the only ships that approach the
shore and are able to lay down a ramp to unload over its bow directly
onto the beach or dock, or open a loading gate in the stern of the ship,
allowing a chain of LSTs to form a floating causeway for larger ships
unloading by ramp into the stern and driving through the LST onto the
beach. Unloading by helicopter or crane onto a dock or small boats is
also workable.
