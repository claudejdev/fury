NATO/US Navy/Amphibious Forces/Amphibious Groups/ESG Kearsarge

ESG Kearsarge has been on patrol in the Mediterranean for the past two
months. At war start she is off the coast of Egypt conducting a training
exercise with the Egyptian air force. As far as ESGs go the escort for
this one is quite weak, USS Bainbridge a 30-year-old CGN, a non-VLS
Spruance, a Farragut class DDG and a Knox class frigate, however with
the Eisenhower CVBG also operating in the Mediterranean this was
considered an acceptable risk. Unfortunately, the Bainbridge was forced
to detach 10 days ago for a major engineering failure in fresh water
system and had to return to Rota Spain for repairs. She is just wrapping
up repairs now but as war starts the Eisenhower is also at the other
side of the Med.

CGN 25 USS Bainbridge, a unique ship based on the Leahy class cruiser,
she was commissioned as a nuclear powered destroyer (DLGN), but was
reclassified to cruiser in 1975. She is a ‘double ended’ air defence
ship meaning she has two Terrier missile launchers and has undergone a
New Threat Upgrade (NTU) making her a capable Air Defence ship.

DD 983 USS John Rodgers is one of seven Spruance class destroyer not
upgraded with a vertical launch system, instead she has an Armored Box
Launcher (ABL) with 8 Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missiles (T-LAM). Her
air defences are relatively weak with only Sea Sparrow for short range
defence but her embarked helicopters provide significant flexibility and
combined with her ASW capability she is a dangerous ship.

Phalanx CIWS.
