BBTG Wisconsin (BB-64)

USS Wisconsin saw service in World War Two, Korean War, and the Gulf
War. In 1956 she was involved in a collision with the Destroyer USS
Eaton, after which her bow was completely replaced with the bow from her
never completed sister, USS Kentucky. She was retired in 1958, and
reactivated in 1988 after a massive upgrade and refurbishment.
Historically she was decommissioned again in 1992, in the Northern Fury
world, this 2<sup>nd</sup> decommissioning did not happen and she still
sails as a key member of the Atlantic Fleet.

At war start she is tied up in Norfolk but is quickly put into action
and, along with the USS Missouri participates first in the amphibious
operations to retake Iceland and then Norway.
