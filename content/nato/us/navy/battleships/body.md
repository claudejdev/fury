The US is the only nation in the world still holding on to World War Two
era Battleships (BB) in 1994, the closest in size and scale would be the
Soviet Kirov class which is much more modern and capable, but also half
the displacement and one third of the crew. Although very impressive the
four Iowa class BBs are hampered by their lack of a Surface to Air
Missile (SAM) system, meaning that they will require an Anti-Air Warfare
(AAW) as well as an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) escort. Those escorts
are always in high demand.

All BBs were refitted in the 1980s and carry 32 Tomahawk Land Attack
Cruise Missiles (TLAM) and 16 Harpoon Anti-Ship Missiles (ASM).
Defensive systems are limited to electronic countermeasures (ECM),
decoys, guns and Close in Weapons System (CIWS). The one significant
weapon that are unique to these ships are the 16” guns. Three of the
four ships have 9 guns while the USS Iowa only had 6 because the \#2
Turret was never repaired after a fire in 1989.

The USS Iowa (**BB-61**), and USS New Jersey (**BB-62**) are in the
Pacific Fleet.  USS Missouri (**BB-63**), and USS Wisconsin (**BB-64**)
are in the Atlantic Fleet. The Iowa is on patrol in the Mediterranean
when Northern Fury starts.
