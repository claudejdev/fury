**USN FF/FFG**

The workhorse of any fleet is its Frigates (FF) and Guided Missile
Frigates (FFG), providing Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) escort, general
duties and patrolling.  The Reagan Administration’s 600 ship Navy
program planned for 101 Frigates – Northern Fury hits this mark with 91
active ships, and 10 in mothballs ready to deploy within 30-60 days.
This is possible mostly because the **Knox** class was not
decommissioned, historically they were all stricken between 1991 and
1994, with a lifespan of only 23 years of service, these ships had at
least 7-10 years of potential service left when they wee scrapped.  With
no replacement Frigate on the horizon, a further 12 **Oliver Hazard
Perry** Class ships were ordered in 91 with the first 4 already launched
and due to commission later in 94. As a stop-gap 4 **Brooke** Class
FFG’s (FFG-3-6) were retained but will be decommissioned later this
year. A ‘**Follow on Frigate**’ program is underway with a bid for 72
units, the first being laid down in early 95 and will replace both the
OHP and the Knox Class in the escort role. A service life of 30 years
remains the target for all ships of this size.

[**Brooke** Class
FFG](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/brookeclass/)All originally
mothballed in 88/89, the sale of the [USS
Brooke](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/brookeclass/) (**FFG-1**) to
Pakistan in 89 went forward and the USS Ramsey (**FFG-2**) was too far
down the decommissioning process to maintain but the remaining 4 were
retained until the new Oliver Hazard Perry class ships begin service
later in 1994. The sale of **FFG-3-5** to Pakistan was canceled. These
ships are nearing the end of their lifespan and are not useful for front
line tasks. Their Tartar missile launchers are capable of firing the
RIM-66 Standard Surface to Air (SAM) missiles, but not quickly. They
carry an SH-2 Seasprite ASW
helicopter.

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/frigrates/image2.jpg)[**Knox**
Class FF](http://www.military-today.com/navy/knox_class.htm)There were
46 [Knox](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/knoxclass/) class ships
built between 1965 and 1974.  Although there were very few variations
when built, the weapons fit during their lifetime was quite diverse. By
1994 however a fairly standard layout had been achieved again; Along
with a 5” gun, each had a Mk 15 Phalanx Close in Weapons System (CIWS),
a Mk 16 Anti Submarine Rocket (ASROC) system that could also fire
Harpoon 4 Anti-Ship Missiles (ASM). There were no Surface to Air (SAM)
missiles but all carried an SH-2 Seasprite ASW helicopter.

These ships are getting old, only have one propeller shaft and are too
slow to keep up with the Carrier Battle Groups, but make excellent
escorts and general duty ships. The Spanish Navy built a further five
examples of this ship, the Baleares class, but foreign sales to Taiwan
and other countries did not occur in Northern fury. More details can be
found
[here](http://www.navyhistory.org/2016/07/our-introduction-to-the-knox-class-frigates-in-the-1970s/).
In an effort to save manpower the USN has put 10 of these ships in
reserve but the other 36 are
active.

[**Oliver Hazard Perry** (OHP) Class
FFG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Hazard_Perry-class_frigate)

The 51 ships of the
[OHP](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/oliverhazardperryclass/) class
are the true workhorses of the USN and a success story for modern ship
design. These ships are propelled by two gas turbines propelling a
single shaft and also have an auxiliary power system for low speeds.
They have 36 RIM-66 Standard SAMs and, 4 Harpoon ASMs launched from a
single launcher, a 3” gun, CIWS and ASW torpedoes.

There are two distinct versions; Short hull, which carry two SH-2
Seasprite (LAMPS I) helicopters, and Long hull, sometimes classified as
**Underwood** class which carry two SH-60 Seahawk (LAMPS III)
helicopters.  These are all capable, well rounded ships that excel at
ASW work, but can still conduct anti-surface tasks with Harpoon missiles
but have a limited Air Defence capacity so work better in company with
an Anti Air Warfare (AAW) ship.

In addition to the 51 American ships, Australia and Spain have six each
and Taiwan operates eight of these ships. In Northern Fury, 12 more are
building with the intent of retiring the 4 Brooke class later in 1994
and putting another 10 Knox class in reserve by
1996.
