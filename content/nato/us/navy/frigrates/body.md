**USN FF/FFG**

The workhorse of any fleet is its Frigates (FF) and Guided Missile
Frigates (FFG), providing Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) escort, general
duties and patrolling.  The Reagan Administration’s 600 ship Navy
program planned for 101 Frigates – Northern Fury gets close to this mark
with 91 active ships, and 10 in ready reserve, able to deploy within
30-60 days. Not retiring the **Knox** class makes this possible;
historically they were all stricken between 1991 and 1994, with a
planned lifespan of 30 years and actual service of only 23 years, these
ships had at least 7-10 years of potential use remaining when they wee
scrapped.  Another critical problem with this type at the end of the
Cold War was that there were replacement Frigate on the horizon, so in
Northern Fury a further 12 **Oliver Hazard Perry** Class ships were
ordered in 1991 with the first four already launched and due to
commission later in 1994. As a stop-gap four **Brooke** Class FFG’s
(FFG-3 to 6) were retained but will be decommissioned later this year. A
‘**Follow on Frigate**’ program is underway with a proposal for 72
units, the first being laid down in early 95, this will replace both the
OHP and the Knox Class in the escort role. A service life of 30 years
remains the target for all ships of this size.

[**Brooke Class**](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/brookeclass/)All
originally mothballed in 88/89, the sale of the [USS
Brooke](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/brookeclass/) (**FFG-1**) to
Pakistan in 89 went forward and the USS Ramsey (**FFG-2**) was too far
down the decommissioning process to maintain but the remaining 4 were
retained until the new Oliver Hazard Perry class ships begin service
later in 1994. The sale of **FFG-3, 4 and 5** to Pakistan was canceled.
These ships are nearing the end of their useful life and are not
suitable for front line tasks. Their Tartar missile launchers are
capable of firing the RIM-66 Standard Surface to Air (SAM) missiles, but
not quickly. They carry an SH-2 Seasprite ASW
helicopter.

[**Knox** Class
FF](http://www.military-today.com/navy/knox_class.htm)There were 46
[Knox](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/knoxclass/) class ships built
between 1965 and 1974.  Although there were very few variations when
built, the weapons fit during their lifetime was quite diverse. By 1994
however a fairly standard layout had been achieved again; along with a
5” gun, each had a Mk 15 Phalanx Close in Weapons System (CIWS), a Mk
16 Anti Submarine Rocket (ASROC) system that could also fire four
Harpoon Anti-Ship Missiles (ASM). There were no Surface to Air (SAM)
missiles but all carried an SH-2 Seasprite ASW helicopter.

These ships are starting to show their age, only have one propeller
shaft and are too slow to keep up with the Carrier Battle Groups, but
make excellent escorts and general duty ships. The Spanish Navy built a
further five improved examples of this type, the Baleares class, but
foreign sales to Taiwan and other countries did not occur in Northern
fury. More details can be found
[here](http://www.navyhistory.org/2016/07/our-introduction-to-the-knox-class-frigates-in-the-1970s/).
In an effort to save manpower the USN has put 10 of these ships in
reserve but the other 36 are
active.

[**Oliver Hazard Perry** (OHP) Class
FFG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Hazard_Perry-class_frigate)

The 51 ships of the
[OHP](http://destroyerhistory.org/coldwar/oliverhazardperryclass/) class
are the true workhorses of the USN and a success story for modern ship
design. These ships are propelled by two gas turbines on a single shaft
and also have an auxiliary power system for stealth and efficiency at
low speeds. They have 36 RIM-66 Standard SAMs and, 4 Harpoon ASMs
launched from a single launcher, a 3” gun, CIWS and ASW torpedoes.

Two distinct versions were built; Short hull, which carry two SH-2
Seasprite (LAMPS I) helicopters, and Long hull, sometimes classified as
the **Underwood** class which carry two SH-60 Seahawk (LAMPS III)
helicopters.  These are capable, well rounded ships that excel at ASW
work, but can still conduct anti-surface tasks with Harpoon missiles and
a gun. They have a limited Air Defence capacity so work better in
company with an Anti Air Warfare (AAW) ship.

In addition to the 51 American ships, Australia and Spain have six each
and Taiwan operates eight of these ships. In Northern Fury, 12 more are
building with the intent of retiring the 4 Brooke class later in 1994
and putting another 10 Knox class in reserve by
1996.
