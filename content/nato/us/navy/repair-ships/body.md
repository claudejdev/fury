**USN Repair Ships**

In order to conduct operations across the globe, the USN needs a network
of repair facilities both fixed and afloat to keep its ships
operational. These Repair ships or ‘Tenders’ conduct routine
maintenance, repair and support to ships at anchor and can augment a
ports facilities or conduct repairs at austere anchorages.

**AD: Destroyer Tenders:**

These ships are vital to the general maintenance of surface ships up to
CG size and can service several simultaneously. The oldest of the three
remaining
[Dixie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie-class_destroyer_tender)
class [USS Prairie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Prairie_(AD-15))
was launched before the US entered World War Two, while her sisters
served during the war, although historically retired in 93-94, as with
many of the combat ships these, venerable workhorses remain in service.
Much more modern, the [Samuel
Gompers](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ad-37.htm) class was built
in the early 60’s while the latest ships of the
[Yellowstone](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ad-41.htm) class were
commissioned in the 80’s. All have received extensive upgrades and
refits to enable their ability to repair modern ships.

**AS: Submarine Tenders:**

These ships are similar to Destroyer Tenders but their tooling and
equipment is configured for maintenance and repair of submarines. The
three remaining
[Fulton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton-class_submarine_tender)
class are all veterans of World War Two and, like the Dixies, were not
retired in the early 90’s. Four more classes provide support to
submarines around the world, the
[Hunley](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/slbm/as-31.htm) class from the
early 60’s, [Simon Lake](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/slbm/as-31.htm)
class from the mid 60’s, [L.Y.
Spear](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/as-36.htm) class from the
early 70’s, and the [Emory S.
Land](https://navaltoday.com/2018/02/12/us-navys-sub-tenders-sail-on-into-the-2020s/)
class from the late 70’s.

**AR: Repair Ship:**

The four World War Two veterans of the
[Vulcan](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ar-5.htm) class are
capable of a wide range of repairs to any ship in the USN. They have
been put into the ready reserve fleet and will take several weeks to
bring up to active status.

There are literally dozens of smaller support and repair ships in the
USN which will not be listed here. These include the 10 ARS (Salvage and
Repair) of the

[Safeguard](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ars-50.htm) classes,
six ASR (Submarine Rescue Ships) of the
[Chanticleer](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/asr-7.htm) and
[Pigeon](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/asr-21.htm), the seven ATF
(Ocean Going Tugs) of the
[Powhatan](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/tatf-166.htm) class, the
five ATS (Salvage Ships) of the
[Edenton](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/ats-1.htm) class, the
three ARC (Cable Repair Ships) of the
[Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Neptune_(ARC-2)) and
[Zeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USNS_Zeus_(T-ARC-7)) class, and
many more.
