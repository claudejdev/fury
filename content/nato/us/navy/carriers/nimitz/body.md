[**CVBG Nimitz (CVN-68)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nimitz)

The *USS Nimitz* is the lead ship of her class, the largest most ships
afloat in any navy, ever. Nicknamed ‘**Old Salt**’ she has already been
active in the US Navy for 19 years by the time war starts in February
1994. Based in San Diego as part of 3<sup>rd</sup> Fleet, she is just
completing a six-month tour of duty in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf
area. She will immediately be tasked with conducting a contested passage
into the Mediterranean and beyond that into the North Atlantic to work
with her East Coast sister ships.

The change in role from peacetime patrol to wartime power projection
means quite a shift in the Battle Group early in the conflict.
