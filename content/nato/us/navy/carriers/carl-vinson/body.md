**[CVBG Carl Vinson
(CVN-70)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Carl_Vinson)**

In Northern Fury, when the *USS Carl Vinson* or ‘**BattleStar**’ came
out of Comprehensive Overhaul (COH) in April of 1993, she was re-based
from San Diego to Norfolk to address the gap in combat power in the
Atlantic while the Enterprise was in its Refueling and COH (RCOH).
Consequently, *CVN-72, George Washington* moved to the Pacific after her
workups later in 93. Historically the *Washington* was in 2nd Fleet in
the Atlantic while the *Vinson* was in 7th Fleet in the Pacific, this is
a simple hull reversal but it left 4x CVNs in the Atlantic and 3x CVNs
in the Pacific. Keeping the much older and smaller *USS Saratoga* was
also a measure to balance the east-west mix. The *Carl Vinson* is tied
up in Norfolk Virginia at the start of the war undergoing routine
maintenance and training. She will be ready to deploy by 16 Feb and in
action by 19 Feb.
