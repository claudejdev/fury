**[USS Forrestal
(AVT-59)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Forrestal_\(CV-59\))**

The *USS Forrestal*, or ‘**Zippo**’ moved to Naval Air Station Pensacola
to replace the *USS Lexington* as the Navy’s training carrier in
September of 92 when she was reclassified as an auxiliary and given the
title ‘AVT’ (Training Aircraft Carrier). Historically this transition
was cancelled early in 93 however, and the USN lost its only dedicated
training carrier.  In Northern Fury the transition continued and by the
end of 93 the *Forrestal* was fully operational as AVT-59.

Flight operations are conducted by Training Air wing 6 (TAW 6) and
includes VT-86 Saberhawks equipped with the 24 of the new T-45C Goshawk.
