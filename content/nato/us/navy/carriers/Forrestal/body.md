**USS Forrestal (AVT-59)**

The USS Forrestal moved to Naval Air Station Pensacola to replace the
USS Lexington as the Navy’s training carrier in September of 92 when she
was reclassified as an auxiliary and given the title ‘AVT’ (Training
Aircraft Carrier). Historically this transition was cancelled early in
93 however, and the USN lost its dedicated training carrier.  In
Northern Fury the transition continued and by the end of 93 she was
fully operational as AVT-59.

Flight operations are conducted by VT-86 Saberhawks equipped with the 24
of the new T-45C Goshawk.
