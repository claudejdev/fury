[**CVBG George Washington
(CVN-73)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_George_Washington_(CVN-73))

Because CVN-70 was kept in the Atlantic due to the increasingly
aggressive stance of a resurgent Soviet Union, joining both *CVN-69
Dwight D. Eisenhower* and ultimately *CVN-71 Theodore Roosevelt*, the
fleets were out of balance. Therefore, both *CVN-72 Abraham Lincoln* and
*CVN-73 George Washington* were based in the Pacific immediately upon
commissioning, joining *CVN-68 Nimitz* and equalizing the new carriers
with three on each coast.

*USS Washington* or *‘**GW***” commenced here career with a 9-month tour
of the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf in 93 and has been conducting
routine maintenance and training since returning San Diego in October of
93. She is currently the ready reaction carrier on the West Coast and
when hostilities commence she will deploy on the 17<sup>th</sup> of Feb
and head to the Philippines area.
