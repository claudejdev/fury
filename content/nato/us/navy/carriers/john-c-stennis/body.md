[**CVBG John C. Stennis
(CVN-74)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_John_C._Stennis)

CVN-74 ‘**Johnny Reb**’ is currently completing construction and is
being rushed into service. She will put to sea for builder’s trials in
Mar 94 and acceptance trials in early April. Commissioning will be
accelerated to 10 April 94 when she will conduct rapid qualification of
all her systems and transit to the North Sea by the end of April. Her
air group, based on the Reserve Air wing for the West Coast (CVWR-30),
is conducting carrier qualification on CV-64 Constellation which is in
the process of reconstituting its air group at San Diego.

The Stennis is destined for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Fleet on the West Coast
but will conduct operations in the North Atlantic for two months prior
to heading back into dry-dock in July to work on any issues discovered
and then transit to San Diego in August. Her Battle Group will form as
required near the end of April and until then will conduct other tasks.
