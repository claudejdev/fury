**[USS Ranger
(CV-61)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Ranger_(CV-61))**

*USS Ranger*, was commissioned in 1957 as the third of four Forrestal
class carriers and through her long life she doesn’t complete a Service
Life Extension Program (SLEP), only a Complex overhaul in 1985/85. She
was nicknamed ‘Top Gun’ after parts of that movie was filmed on board.
Due for de-commissioning after the Gulf War, she was saved from the
scrapers when heightened tensions caused an adjustment to that plan.
Instead she followed *CV-41 Midway* into the Reserve fleet when that
carrier was moved to inactive reserve in early 92. Since that time she’s
been tied up with a skeleton crew, but will activate again at the start
of the war. In late March she will sail for the Western Pacific in
direct support of the USMC 3<sup>rd</sup> Marine Amphibious Force, and
then the Indian Ocean to relieve her sister ship *CV-60 Saratoga*,
allowing ‘Sara’ some badly needed and overdue maintenance time.
