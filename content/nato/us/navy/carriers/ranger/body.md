NATO/US Navy/US Navy CVBGs

USS Ranger (CV-61)

USS Ranger, was commissioned in 1957 as the third of four Forrestal
class carriers, she does not complete a Service Life Extension Program
(SLEP), only a Complex overhaul in 1985/85. After service in the Gulf
War, she was due for de-commissioning until heightened tensions caused
an adjustment of that plan. Instead she followed CV-41 Midway into the
Reserve fleet when that carrier was decommissioned in early 92. Since
that time she has been tied up but will activate again at the start of
the war, sailing for the Western Pacific in direct support of the USMC
3<sup>rd</sup> Marine Amphibious Force, and then the Indian Ocean to
relieve her sister ship CV-60 Saratoga, allowing ‘Sara’ some badly
needed and overdue maintenance time.
