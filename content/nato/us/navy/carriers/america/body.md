[**USS America
(CV-66)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_America_(CV-66))

CV-66, nicknamed ‘**The Big A**’ had just returned from an 8-month
patrol in the Mediterranean a week before war start. She’d been replaced
by *CVN-69 Eisenhower* and was long overdue for a 4-6-month maintenance
overhaul in dry-dock. She enters dry-dock two days after war start and
her air group (CVW-1) and battle group are dispersed amongst the fleet.
She hastily emerges from the Navy Yard in April of 94 with a rebuilt air
group based on the East Coast Reserve wing CVWR-20 and is in time to
joint the fleet actions in May.
