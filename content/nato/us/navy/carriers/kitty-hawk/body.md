CVBG Kitty Hawk (CV-63)

USS Kitty Hawk, or Battle Cat was commissioned in 1961, six months ahead
of her sister ship the Constellation, and completed a 3-year long
Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) in August of 1990 which prepared
her for another 20 years of sailing. When war breaks out she is tied up
at San Diego going through a period of routine maintenance. She will
deploy to the western Pacific to join the other carriers of the Pacific
Fleet by the end of February.
