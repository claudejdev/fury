NATO/US Navy/Amphibious Forces/Amphibious Groups

The US Navy has a very flexible system of providing credible power
projection anywhere on the globe by using a combination of its Aircraft
Carriers and Amphibious forces. The USMC provides a considerable part of
this power projection in the form of its Marine Air/Ground Task Forces
([MAGTF](https://marinecorpsconceptsandprograms.com/organizations/marine-air-ground-task-force/marine-air-ground-task-force-magtf)).

In the 1980’s the USMC transitioned from its more traditional
‘Amphibious’ force to the modern ‘Expeditionary’ force. Thus the
development of a more comprehensive combined arms doctrine was needed
and this resulted in the evolution of ‘Expeditionary’ elements which
were more self sustained and cohesive than the previous ‘Amphibious’
elements. This evolution was linked to the development of pre-positioned
equipment in key locations around the globe and a gradual change in
organization.

A MAGTF is completely scalable from as small as a few hundred Marines to
as large as a 32000-man Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF). Whatever the
size however, there are always four elements to a MAGTF:

  - **Command Element (CE)** to provide command, control,
    communications, intelligence and to coordinate joint effects in
    support of the mission.

  - **Ground Combat Element (GCE)** providing the combined arms effects
    needed for the mission.

  - **Aviation Combat Element (ACE)** which is task tailored to provide
    all air effects necessary for the accomplishment of the mission.

  - **Logistics Combat Element (LCE)** organized to provide all logistic
    functions to both the ground and aviation combat elements.

In 1994 there were three main sizes of MAGTF’s which roughly correspond
to Army unit sizes, but are much more powerful and flexible due to the
integration of the ACE.

  - **Marine Expeditionary Unit** **(MEU):** Based on a Battalion sized
    GCE with a combined arms complement of approximately 2,200 marines.
    
      - **CE** is small but able to coordinate the effects of all combat
        elements of the MEU
    
      - **GCE** is based on a Battalion with attached artillery, armor,
        combat engineer, both armored and light reconnaissance and
        amphibious vehicles. The GCE represents about half of the MEU’s
        personnel.
    
      - **ACE** is based on a composite squadron of transport
        helicopters, Attack helicopters and Harriers.
    
      - **LCE** provides all combat service support required to sustain
        the MEU for approximately 15 days.
