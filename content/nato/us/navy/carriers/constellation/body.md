**[CVBG Constellation
(CV-64)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constellation_(CV-64))**

USS Constellation, or ‘**Connie’** was commissioned in 1961, but the
33-year-old carrier had completed a 3-year Service Life Extension
Program (SLEP) in March of 1993 which prepared her for another 20 years
of sailing. When war breaks out she is conducting a training exercise
with the Philippine Navy and Air Force after spending several months
visiting various western Pacific countries. She was due to return to San
Diego in late February but was rushed north to support *USS Independence
(CV-62)* when the war started. Her air group takes a beating in the
first days of the war and she is withdrawn to the West Coast to
reconstitute.
