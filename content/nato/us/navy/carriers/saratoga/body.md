CVBG Saratoga (CV-66)

USS Saratoga, was commissioned in 1956 as the second of four Forrestal
class carriers, she completed a 3-year long Service Life Extension
Program (SLEP) in February of 1983, the first ship to do so, which
prepared her for another 15 years of sailing. Although she spent most of
her service life in the Mediterranean, she was now based in San Diego
and in the middle of an eight-month deployment to the Indian Ocean
Persian/Gulf region. At the start of the war, she was on patrol in the
Arabian Sea and would soon find herself alone in that region as other
carriers were pulled to the Mediterranean or the Pacific. Due to the
reduced threat in the Indian Ocean region there was quite a bit of
turmoil with Saratogaâ€™s escorts. She is due for some badly needed
maintenance starting late summer in San Diego and is relieved by USS
Ranger.
