[**CVBG Abraham Lincoln
(CVN-72)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Abraham_Lincoln_\(CVN-72\))

CVN-72 or ‘**Abe**’ is deployed to the Pacific Fleet as planned in 1991
to join *CVN-68 Nimitz* as the second nuclear powered carrier on the
west coast. When war starts she’s in the process of deploying to the
Indian Ocean, enroute to the Persian Gulf to replace the *Nimitz* for an
8-month deployment. Departing the US before Christmas 1993 she conducted
an exercise with *CV-62 Independence* and *CV-63 Kitty Hawk* (just
returning from the Persian Gulf) off of the Philippines in January,
followed by a port visit to Sydney Australia at the beginning of
February. She is heading to the Indian Ocean at war start but will
almost immediately be recalled to the Pacific to help stabilize maters
there.
