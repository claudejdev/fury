**USN Aircraft Carriers**

Aircraft carriers are a key lynchpin in US global power projection
policy. In peacetime they exhibit America’s military strength and
interest wherever they’re deployed and at war they are fundamental in
carrying out theatre level plans and operations. This
[blog](http://northernfury.us/blog/post8/) explains in detail the
situation regarding aircraft carriers at the start of Northern Fury.
Below is a list of the aircraft carriers currently in commission.

[**Midway
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway-class_aircraft_carrier):
Both remaining ships of this class were built in World War Two and
served a long and productive career operating throughout the Cold War,
Viet Nam and many other conflicts; they were modernized several times.
***Midway*** deployed to the Gulf war and ***Coral Sea*** earned the
nickname ‘Ageless Warrior’. Both are retired to the inactive reserve and
laid up at Bremerton Washington but could be re-commissioned with about
1 year of work. One major drawback to these carriers is that they were
too small to operate the USNs primary air superiority fighter, the F-14
Tomcat, instead they would routinely deploy with three F/A-18 squadrons
and two A-6E squadrons. With the A-6E retiring early in Northern Fury,
they would need a full wing of F/A-18s.

| Class  | Ship      | Pennant | Status       | Location   | Task    | Available |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Midway | Midway    | CV-41   | Retired 1992 | West Coast | Reserve | Mar-95    |
|        | Coral Sea | CV-43   | Retired 1990 | West Coast | Reserve | May-95    |

[**Forrestal
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrestal-class_aircraft_carrier):
These four venerable ships have been sailing since the 50’s and have
extensive combat experience. Built from the keel up as ‘Supercarriers’
they displaced 25% more than the Midway class, were 100 feet longer and
also wider, and could operate 80-100 jet aircraft. They had a much
deeper hull, an armored flight deck and four elevators. Although these
ships were effective they were 40 years old and destined to retire as
the Nimitz class ships come on line; until increased tensions caused a
re-think on that plan. ***Saratoga*** and ***Independence*** are still
operational, while ***Forrestal*** is operating as a training ship and
***Ranger*** is in active reserve with a skeleton crew, she will take
30-60 days to activate.

| Class     | Ship         | Pennant | Status         | Location   | Task           | Available |
|-----------|--------------|---------|----------------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Forrestal | Forrestal    | AVT-59  | Training       | East Coast | Training       |           |
|           | Saratoga     | CV-60   | Active         | Indian     | Patrol         |           |
|           | Ranger       | CV-61   | Active Reserve | West Coast | Active Reserve | April-94  |
|           | Independence | CV-62   | Active         | Pacific    | Philippines    |           |

[**Kitty Hawk
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_Hawk-class_aircraft_carrier):
Often called ‘Improved ***Forrestal***’***s***’ these four ships were
newer, longer, and their elevators were repositioned to improve aircraft
handling. Fourth in this class, the *John F. Kennedy* has so many
variations from the original design that she is often considered a
single ship class. These were the last conventionally powered aircraft
carriers built; the ***USS* *Enterprise*** was built alongside the first
two ships and claimed the ‘65’ pennant but more importantly paved the
way for nuclear propulsion of the follow on ***Nimitz*** class.

| Class      | Ship           | Pennant | Status | Location  | Task    | Available |
|------------|----------------|---------|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Kitty Hawk | Kitty Hawk     | CV-63   | Active | Pacific   | Tied Up | Feb-94    |
|            | Constellation  | CV-64   | Active | Pacific   | Japan   |           |
|            | America        | CV-66   | Active | Atlantic  | Refit   | Jul-94    |
|            | John F Kennedy | CV-67   | Active | Caribbean | Patrol  |           |

**[Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(CVN-65)):** The
***Enterprise*** is the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier and
although the plan was for a class of six ships, those plans were
canceled and she became a single ship class. Lunched in 1961 she is just
finishing her mid-life ‘Refueling and Complex Overhaul’ (RCOH) in 40
vice the actual 48 months that it took historically. She sails for
workups in Puerto Rico on 4 Feb 94 and was re-routed for Iceland on 11
Feb in response to heighted threat.

| Class      | Ship       | Pennant | Status | Location | Task    | Available |
|------------|------------|---------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Enterprise | Enterprise | CVN-65  | Active | P Rico   | Workups |           |

**[Nimitz
Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimitz-class_aircraft_carrier):** The
epitome of modern aircraft carriers, the ***Nimitz*** represents the
culmination of 50 years’ evolution of aircraft carrier operations. Seven
of the eventual ten ships of this class are represented in Northern
Fury.  The seventh, ***CVN-74 John C. Stennis*** was started in Jan 1990
in response to the increased threat from the Soviet Union, immediately
space was made available behind ***CVN-73 George Washington***. After
starting work 14 months early she will be commissioned 20 months early
in April of 94.
