*USS John F Kennedy* or ‘**Big John**’ was the newest conventionally
powered Aircraft Carrier in the American Fleet, and at 25 years of
service had emerged from a mid-life refit in 1993.  Departing Norfolk in
June of 93, she and parts of her Battle Group temporarily re-based to
New Orleans and are conducting training in the Gulf of Mexico and
Caribbean when war broke out.  After some intense action she is destined
to reconfigure her air group and take up duties securing the Sea Lines
of Communications.
