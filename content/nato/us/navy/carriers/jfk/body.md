NATO/US Navy/US Navy CVBGs

**CVBG John F Kennedy (CV-67) **

USS John F Kennedy was the newest conventionally powered Aircraft
Carrier in the American Fleet, and at 25 years of service had emerged
from a mid-life refit in 1993.  Departing Norfolk just after Christmas,
she and parts of her Battle Group were conducting training in the Gulf
of Mexico and Caribbean when war broke out.  After some intense action
she is destined to reconfigure her air group and take up duties securing
the Sea Lines of Communications.
