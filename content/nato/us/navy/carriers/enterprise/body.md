**[CVBG Enterprise
(CVN-65)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(CVN-65))**

The *USS Enterprise* or ‘**Big E**’ was rushed through her Complex
Refueling and Overhaul (ROH), putting to sea for initial tests in late
Jan 94, several months in advance of her historic schedule. The Big-E
and elements of her Battle Group departed Norfolk on 4th of February to
carry out workup trials and training in Puerto Rico, where the rest of
the Battle Group joined them. On 11 Feb, 4 days into a 10-day testing
and training schedule she is ordered north at best speed, destination
the GIUK Gap. The start of the war finds her steaming northward toward
her first engagement on the 17th of Feb.
