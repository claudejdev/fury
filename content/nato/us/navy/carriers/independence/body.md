**[CVBG Independence
(CV-62)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Independence_(CV-62))**

*USS Independence*, or ‘**Indy**’ was commissioned in 1959 as the last
of the four Forrestal class carriers, she completed a 3-year Service
Life Extension Program (SLEP) in June of 1988 which prepared her for
another 15 years of sailing. In 1991 the *Independence* replaced *CV-43
Midway* as the US Navies forward deployed carrier in Yokosuka Japan.
When war breaks out she is conducting a routine patrol with a reduced
escort in the Sea of Japan, she will survive but the same cannot be said
for some of her escort.
