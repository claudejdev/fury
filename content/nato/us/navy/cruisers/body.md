**USN CG/CGN**

The US Navy fields three main classes of conventionally powered Guided
Missile Cruiser (CG), in addition to the nine nuclear powered Cruisers
(CGN) of various classes. These powerful ships provide Anti-Air Warfare
(AAW) escort to the aircraft carrier battle groups (CVBGs) and are often
employed independently and as flagships of surface action groups (SAGs).
Historically both the Leahy and Belknap classes, nine ships each, all
newly upgraded with New Threat Update (NTU) overhauls, as well as the
nine CGNs were retired as part of the ‘Peace Dividend’ leaving only the
Ticonderoga class to serve past the mid 90’s.  Northern Fury has all of
these ships retained in service, they had an average life of 28-30 years
when historically decommissions and could easily have served another 10
years.

**[Long
Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Long_Beach_\(CGN-9\)):**
(**CGN-9**) The Long Beach was a single ship class and was the first
nuclear powered surface warship in service. Throughout her long life she
set many records and by 1994 was the oldest cruiser in the Navy. She
completed her mid life overall in 1982 giving here two twin Terrier
launchers the ability to fire SM-1(ER) Standard missiles, but although
there was a landing pad she did not carry a helicopter, and her upgrades
would not be considered adequate to keep her in front line
operation.

[**Leahy/Bainbridge
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leahy-class_cruiser): The nine
ships of the Leahy class and the single nuclear powered Bainbridge CGN
were essentially the same ship except for the power plant. As double
ended SAM shooters, this class was designed without a main gun but they
had SAM launchers both bow and stern. Although no other class was built
without a gun, the extra space allowed for more missile storage, 76
missiles vice 50 in the Bainbridge class. All ships went through an NTU
during the 1980s, USS Gridley as late as 1991, and can fire the SM-2(ER)
Standard missile; the terrier launchers are slow compared to a Vertical
Launch System (VLS) but with two double launchers and four Mk 76 Fire
Control Radars, they were able to maintain a respectable rate of fire.
These ships do not carry a helicopter but had landing
facilities.

[**Belknap/Truxton
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belknap-class_cruiser): The nine
ships of the Belknap class along with the single Truxton CGN differed
from the Leahy class as they had a gun but were only single ended SAM
shooters. All had undergone and NTU in the 1980s and all could use the
SM-2(ER) Standard missile from their single twin launcher. These ships
were therefore more versatile but less capable in the AAW role than
their predecessors. Like the Leahy class helicopters were able to land
but there was no hangar for storage or
servicing.

[**California
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California-class_cruiser): Both
California class CGNs had just emerged from their New Threat Upgrade
(NTU) and nuclear refueling overhauls, in fact South Carolina completed
her overhaul in Jan 94 (2 months early). These are big ships, 25% more
displacement than the Belknap class and correct the weakness of both
previous classes; they are double ended SAM shooters with a much more
modern Mk 26 launchers and slightly more missiles than the Leahy class,
plus they have two guns like the Belknaps. As with the other classes
however, they do not have a hanger for a permanent
helicopter.

**Virginia Class**: The four Virginia Class CGNs, although completed in
the late 70’s, were somewhat out of date and a rapid ‘Semi-NTU’ program
was commissioned to correct the shortfalls. From a long term budgeting
standpoint these ships were expensive to maintain and were due for their
mid-life refueling – this spelled their doom historically and in
Northern Fury they have not yet been refueled. Like the California Class
these were ‘Double Enders’ with the modern Mk 26 launcher but only 64
missiles. These ships also carried two guns, harpoon SSMs, Tomahawk Land
attack cruise missiles (TLAM) ASROC ASW rockets and other systems, but
no landing pad for
helicopters.

[**Ticonderoga
Class**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticonderoga-class_cruiser): The
27 ships of the Ticonderoga class were truly a paradigm changing design.
Sometimes considered the most powerful surface combatant in service in
the world, these ships are capable of controlling the air defence
firepower of an entire task force using the AEGIS Combat system.
Augmented with VLS (vertical launch missile systems), Tomahawk Cruise
missiles and onboard helicopters, these ships were built in five groups,
each with gradually more capable equipment. In Northern Fury, the
building of the final ship **CG-73** Port Royal was accelerated by 5
months and she was commissioned in Jan 94 vice the historical date of 4
July 94.

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/cruisers/image7.jpg)

The first 5 ships, Baseline ‘0’ and Baseline ‘1’ were equipped with the
same two Mk 26 SAM launchers as the Virginia class but had a crew of
half the size, operated the AEGIS combat system, had hangar space for
two helicopters and more secondary capabilities. From Baseline ‘2’
onward the ships used 2x 61-Cell VLS launchers which were far quicker
and able to employ almost any missile in the inventory. Baseline ‘2’,
‘3’, and ‘4’ have gradually improving systems including lighter and
more capable radar, better computing systems etc. More information is
available at this [link](https://www.navysite.de/cg/cg47class.htm). It
is standard practice to have two Ticonderoga Class in each
CVBG.

**[Albany Class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany-class_cruiser):**
The two remaining ships of the Albany class are the only Cruisers in
ready reserve. These ships are old; based on the Oregon City and
Baltimore heavy cruiser classes of World War Two and were originally
commissioned in 1945 and 1946, USS Chicago saw some limited war service.
Extensively rebuilt in the early 1960s this three ship class (USS
Columbus was scrapped in 1977) saw extensive service and both remaining
ships served as long time Fleet Flagships. Historically they were
scrapped in 1990/91 but are retained in reserve for Northern Fury. They
have old missile systems with Mk 11 and Mk 12 launchers and
[Tarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIM-24_Tartar) and
[Talos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIM-8_Talos) SAMs. Both ships will
see active service in Northern Fury, releasing other CGs from secondary
roles, the critical path however are the missiles which have all been
refurbished but are in short
supply.
