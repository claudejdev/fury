***A-6 Intruder***

The A-6 family of aircraft were venerable workhorses within the USN with
445 of them working in the fleet since they were introduced in the mid
1960’s. In the Northern Fury world two key decisions were made:

1.  The A-6 *Intruder*, as a single role airframe would be retired
    early. This decision was made in 1989 and was linked to the
    increased production of the F/A-18 Hornets. Therefore; conversion of
    the A-6E TRAM (Target Recognition and Attack Multi-Sensor) to the
    A-6E SWIP (System Weapons Improvement Program) was canceled with
    only half the fleet converted; and, all A-6E SWIP would be placed in
    preservation storage by the middle of 1994.  The accelerated
    schedule meant that by the time Northern Fury starts, all USMC
    Squadrons had already converted, or were converting to the Hornet
    and only 2 Squadrons remain in the Fleet: VA-176 ‘Thunderbolts’ in
    CVW-6 on the USS Enterprise, and VA-115 ‘Eagles’ in CVW-5 on the USS
    Independence based in Japan. The remainder are processing through
    the three readiness Squadrons into storage.

2.  Realizing somewhat belatedly that the threat from the Soviet bloc
    was increasing. Congress authorized the purchase of 100 new build
    A-6F *Intruder II*, in 1992. The *Intruder II* had vastly improved
    avionics and sensors, a ‘non-afterburner version of the same engine
    the F/A-18 used, more hard points for weapons, and the ability to
    use the Aim-120 AMRAAM air to air missile.  These 100 aircraft would
    outfit 6 squadrons, plus training and evaluation units, and be
    assigned as required to CVW’s or land establishments. The first two
    Squadrons (VF-52 ‘Knightriders’, and VF-55 ‘Warhorses’) were
    receiving their aircraft and undergoing type training at the
    outbreak of the war.

In the early days of the conflict the pentagon would partially reverse
the first decision, rebuilding 6 Squadrons of A-6E SWIP and fielding
them initially with 8 aircraft each. As airframes become available these
squadrons, and the two Sqns currently in the fleet which have 10
aircraft; will be bulked up to 12 each.  Combined with the 6 A-6F
squadrons, the fleet will maintain a total of 14 Attack (VA) squadrons,
with a possibility of forming 4 additional USMC (VMA) Squadrons by the
end of 1994.

The Tanker version, designed specifically for air to air refueling, the
KA-6D had also been retired, but because these aircraft were so heavily
used during their lifetime, they were unrecoverable and would not be
re-commissioned.

| Sqn    | Name             | CVW  | No. | Type  | Remarks            |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---- | --- | ----- | ------------------ |
| VA-176 | Thunderbolts     | A-6E | 10  | CAW-6 | USS Enterprise     |
| VA-115 | Eagles           | A-6E | 10  | CVW-5 | USS Independence   |
| VA-42  | Green Pawns      | A-6E | 20  | FRS   | NAS Oceana         |
| VA-128 | Golden Intruders | A-6E | 36  | FRS   | NAS Whidbey Island |
| VA-155 | Silver Foxes     | A-6E | 16  | FRS   | NAS Whidbey Island |

The remaining aircraft of the Intruder family was the most specialized. 
The EA-6B *Prowler*, was the fleet Electronic Warfare (EW) aircraft.
These aircraft were so effective that the USAF was using 16 of them to
complement their fleet of EW aircraft. Each CVW had a Squadron of 5
Prowlers and the USMC had an additional 4 Squadrons.  Slow rate
production (4/yr) was restarted in 1992 with the first aircraft coming
off the line in July or Aug of 1994, this aircraft is detailed in the
Carrier Support section.
