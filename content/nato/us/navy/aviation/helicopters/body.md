**USN Helicopters**

The USN operates numerous helicopter fleets, primarily for ASW
(Anti-Submarine Warfare) but also for SAR (Search and Rescue), logistics
and general tasks. This section will not discuss US Marine Corps (USMC)
helicopters which are covered in the amphibious section.

[**SH-2 Seasprite**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/sh-2.htm)

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/aviation/helicopters/image1.jpg)The
Seasprite fulfilled the light ASW role, answering the specification for
LAMPS 2 (Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System). The name is odd because
the SH-2 is such a small platform that its ability to fulfil
multi-purpose aspect of the title is questionable, although a hoist
could be fitted and a slung load could be carried. The Seasprite was
widely used throughout the Viet Nam war era, flying off the small decks
of many US ships, but it was approaching retirement and due to be
replaced by the SH-60B. Complications arose to this plan in the 1980s
because of the 600 ship navy plan. The SH-2 was the only helicopter able
to operate off the Knox class and older frigates as well as many of the
early Oliver Hazard Perry ships. So the SH-2G ‘Super Seasprite’ was
developed, historically these were sent immediately to the Reserves due
to a shrinking fleet and only 24 were acquired (6 new and 18
conversions), in Northern Fury they all remain in the active fleet and
24 more older aircraft were converted for a fleet total of 48 ‘Super
Seasprites’. The plan was further complicated due to the Gulf War in
1991, for deployment there 16 SH-2Fs were fitted with forward looking
infra-red (FLIR) cameras and other fitting, these remain in service as
well. In total there are 112 Seasprites are in the fleet and about a
dozen held in
readiness.

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/aviation/helicopters/image2.jpeg)[**SH-3
Sea King**](http://www.airvectors.net/avs61_1.html#m3)At its peak the
USN operated well over 300 of the powerful and amphibious SH-3 Sea King
helicopters but is currently retiring the bulk of that fleet. The two
roles remaining to the Sea King are:

  - ASW, where it is being replaced by the SH-60F Oceanhawk in the
    Carrier Air Wings (CVW). Both the Sea King and the new Oceanhawk
    differ from other US ASW helicopters by having dipping sonar,
    allowing them to use active sonar at depth near the very noisy
    carrier.

  - SAR (Search and Rescue) and general utility. The SAR task will be
    taken up by the HH-60H ‘Rescue Hawk’ but only on the CVWs and
    Special Forces squadrons. General duties and shore based SAR will be
    conducted by the last remaining 26 UH-3H Sea Kings and a variety of
    other
means.

[**SH-60
Seahawk**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/sh-60.htm)

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/aviation/helicopters/image3.jpeg)Ideally
the USN wanted to replace all (or most) helicopters with this one single
family of aircraft. The very robust and capable Seahawk is the maritime
variant of the armies UH-60 Blackhawk. The USAF and US Coast Guard were
also adopting variants making pan-defence efficiencies. The USN acquired
three variants, all with the name Seahawk but unofficially with adopted
names:

  - [SH-60B
    Seahawk](http://www.sikorskyarchives.com/S-60B%20\(SH-60B%20Seahawk,%20SH-60F%20CV,%20HH-60H%20Rescue%20Hawk,%20HH-60J%20Jayhawk,%20VH-60N\).php),
    rugged and powerful ASW helicopter with modern and capable ASW
    systems, a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD), 25 sonobuoys, a powerful
    search radar, FLIR and air launched torpedoes or Penguin Anti-Ship
    Missiles (ASM). These are equipped with a RAST system to assist them
    landing on a small deck. In total, 181 SH-60B were produced.

  - [SH-60F
    Oceanhawk](http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMWYA2_Sikorsky_SH_60F_Seahawk_San_Diego_CA),
    designed for operating of aircraft carriers, this model exchanges
    the RAST system, the MAD, the search radar and the onboard sonobouys
    for active dipping sonar enabling it to hunt submarines near the
    center of a very noisy task group. The Oceanhawk has only 6
    sonobouys launched from an external mount. The USN procured 76
    SH-60F but only 45 have been
    delivered.

  - [HH-60H Rescue
    Hawk](http://www.nhahistoricalsociety.org/index.php/sh-60f-sikorsky-s-70b-seahawk-helicopter/),
    primarily used by two Special Forces CSAR (Combat Search and Rescue)
    squadrons, this aircraft is based on the SH-60F but has many
    survivability features including
    ![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/aviation/helicopters/image5.jpeg)electronic
    countermeasures, jammers and chaff/flare dispensers. It can fire the
    AGM-114 Hellfire missile. In addition to the CSAR squadrons, each HS
    (Helicopter ASW) squadron is equipped with two HH-60H to augment the
    six SH-60Fs. Only 42 of this type were
produced.

[**CH/UH/HH-46 Sea
Knight**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Vertol_CH-46_Sea_Knight)These
twin engine medium lift helicopters fulfill a number of roles across the
Navy. The CH-46D airframe is shared with the USMC and is used for
general cargo transport. The UH-46D is used for cargo transport,
primarily off of replenishment ships. The HH-46D are used as SAR
helicopters, primarily off fixed USN bases

[**MH-53E Sea
Dragon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_CH-53E_Super_Stallion)The
USN operates the MH-53E primarily in the mine clearing role but these
aircraft are also very capable heavy lift helicopters. All three
squadrons are located at NAS Norfolk but are deployable worldwide via
C-5 Galaxy to any trouble spot. HM-14 is affiliated with Pacific Fleet.

[**UH-1N**](https://www.navy.mil/navydata/fact_display.asp?cid=1200&tid=100&ct=1)

The Navy operates about 25 UH-1N Iroquois (Twin Huey) light utility
helicopters in both the SAR , VIP transport and utility roles. As the
USMC retires their UH-1N in favour of the UH-1Y, the USN is able to
absorb more and deploy them as needed.
