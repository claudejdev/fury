**USN Support Aircraft**

The USN operates one of the largest air forces in the world, and
supports another of the world’s largest air forces – the US Marine
Corps. Therefore the number of aircraft needed to sustain this force is
large and diverse. This section does not hope to capture every
non-combat aircraft operated by the USN but simply to highlight the
major types and give an idea of the scope.

**Transport**

Moving people, special cargo, important visitors and key senior officers
around the world is a significant task performed by 14 ‘Fleet Logistics
Support Squadrons’ (VR) flying three main types of aircraft, the
venerable C-130 Hercules, the converted airliner C-9 Skytrain II and
converted executive Gulfstream II and IV jets. The job of delivering the
passengers and cargo to the fleet falls to 3 more tactical squadrons
with the same name but designated VRC. The VRCs conduct ‘Carrier Onboard
Delivery’ or COD, landing directly on the carriers, they primarily use
the C-2A-R Greyhound but are supplemented by a handful of converted
US-3A
Vikings.

**Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRS)**

In addition to the Fleet Replacement Squadrons mentioned specific to
types of Aircraft these Three Sqns collected a wide range of aircraft
and conducted adversary training for the Navy as a whole. All flew out
of bases on the East Coast but deployed widely as tasks
required.

**Advanced Training**

US Naval Aviation training is some of the most advanced and progressive
in the world, and requires a lot of effort to conduct. There are two
main types of squadron supporting this activity, ‘Fleet Composite
Squadron’ (VC) and ‘Fighter Squadron Composite’ VCR. These squadrons
operate multiple types of aircraft and conduct multiple functions. The
most complex function would be DACT, or Dissimilar Air Combat Training,
where the VC or VCR elements try and replicate Soviet aircraft types,
doctrine and tactics. Other functions performed by some of these
squadrons are target towing, target drone, aerial target photography and
general range
services.

**Basic flight and carrier Training**

All naval aviators learn to fly on the T-34C ‘Mentor’ before advancing
to various advanced training squadrons for either advanced jet training
on the T-45C ‘Goshawk’, advanced turboprop training on the T-44A
‘Pegasus’ or advanced helicopter training on the TH-57 ‘Jet Ranger’.
As a student progresses through the program s/he will be selected to
proceed to specific types. Those going to VF or VFA squadrons will spend
time on the TA-4J Skyhawk while those proceeding to VS or VQ squadrons
will move to the T-2C Buckeye, while helicopter and turbo-prop pilots
will advance to more specific training and then to the actual aircraft
for operational training. All who are destined for duty on aircraft
carriers will proceed through VT-86 to practice carrier operations on
the USS
Forrestal.

**Test & Evaluation**

The USN’s Test and Evaluation organization was undergoing change in the
early 90’s in an effort to consolidate infrastructure and gain
efficiency. Below represents what I believe was in place, or would have
been in place in early 1994 for Northern
Fury.

listed here. The Polar express LC-130Rs to the Navy Demonstration team
the ***Blue Angels***, as well as the specialists in Oceanographic
mapping.
