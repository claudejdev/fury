**Patrol Aircraft**

The USN operates three types of patrol aircraft, the primary being ASW
patrol (Anti-Submarine Warfare) but also for intelligence gathering and
strategic communications. These aircraft are all based on civilian
airliners and have long endurance, large crews, very modular equipment
which is easy to upgrade but are quiet vulnerable to enemy action. These
are valuable aircraft so any loss would have a significant impact and
gain high level attention.

[**P-3 Orion**](http://www.p3orion.nl/index.html)

The US land based ASW fleet consists of only one aircraft type, the
Lockheed P-3 Orion. Although it’s used across NATO, the USN is by far
the most important operator with 24 ‘Fleet’ squadrons of 9 aircraft
each, augmented by 13 Reserve squadrons, two Fleet Replacement squadrons
(FRS) and numerous testing, support and special duty units. All told the
USN operates about 400 P-3s of various versions. Introduced in 1962, the
last of the original P-3As have been retired and all of the P-3Bs have
been relegated to reserve and training squadrons, special purpose units
or test and evaluation establishments. All 24 regular fleet squadrons as
well as 4 of the reserve squadrons fly P-3C, but there are five
different upgrade levels of that airframe in the mix. The most modern
and capable version are the 37 P-3C Update III and the 121 older
aircraft that have been upgraded to that standard (P-3C Update IIIR).
Plans exist to bring all of the ‘Update I’ and ‘Update II’ airframes up
to the ‘IIIR’ standard, but the ‘Update II.5’ aircraft will take a
different path in the late ‘90s. Historically several squadrons were
retired between 1991 and 1994 but in Northern Fury this does not happen
and therefore 5 reserve squadrons held onto the P-3B longer than in real
life.

[**EP-3E ARIES & ARIES
II**](https://fas.org/irp/program/collect/ep-3_aries.htm)

Exclusively focused on ELINT or Electronic Intelligence gathering, two
versions of the EP-3E are in service at the start of 1994. All 12 of the
original EP-3E ARIES are available, although some are at a reduced state
of readiness, these are based on the P-3A and P-3B airframes with all
ASW equipment removed and replaced with electronic monitoring systems,
two of the 12 had a very interesting
[life](http://www.p3orion.nl/sneaky.html) in the CIA and elsewhere
before conversion. The EP-3E ARIES II were new build P-3C airframes
loaded with more modern and advances equipment and antennae,
historically these were delayed due to negotiations with the USAF and
Congress, however in Northern Fury production was expedited and 8 of the
planed 12 airframes are available. The two squadrons flying this type
have a mix of the ARIES and ARIES II airframes and have global
responsibilities. The aircraft are routinely deployed to any potential
conflict zone or area where interesting electronic intelligence may be
available or of use.

[**E-6A Mercury**](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/c3i/e-6.htm)

These Boing 707 based aircraft serve as a survivable command link to the
US Ballistic Missile submarines (SSBN) and are the equivalent to the
USAFs EC-135C ‘Looking Glass’. Developed under the navy’s TACAMO (take
charge and move out) program they have transferred to US Strategic
Command (USSTRATCOM) for direct control of the nuclear missiles, however
the USN still operates the aircraft and uses them to relay messages to
all submarines, not just the SSBNs. The original production schedule had
the last 4 airframes arriving in 1994, this has been accelerated
slightly and all but the last aircraft have been received and the
16<sup>th</sup> will arrive in March 1994.
