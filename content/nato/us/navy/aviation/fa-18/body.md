***F/A-18 Hornet***

The F/A-18 was fast turning into a success story for the USN but the
initial ‘A’ model came with some controversy and was a compromise of
requirements.  It was not as good as the F-14 in the Air to Air role,
and it did not have the bomb load or range of the A-6’s or A-7’s it was
supposed to replace.  Nonetheless; it was modern, agile, quicker to
repair and much cheaper to operate than the F-14, and it could drop
bombs almost as good as an A-6, just not as many. To a cash strapped
navy however, it was a solution to many problems, primarily because it
was capable of fulfilling multiple roles. In Northern Fury this was even
more important as the Navy was required to maintain more ships, and more
Aircraft Carriers and therefore more Air Wings. So the retirement of the
A-6 was accelerated as was the procurement of the F/A-18.

The airframe was also an international sales success with Canada,
Australia, Spain and Kuwait already operating it and several others in
negotiations.

The ramp up in tensions equated to an extension of F/A-18 production to
equip an additional CVW and ensure there were enough capable airframes
available.  In total Northern Fury has 10 additional VFA (USN Fighter
Attack) squadrons and the USMC has 5 additional VMFA (USMC Fighter
Attack) squadrons. Total production of F/A-18’s is up by 120 airframes
over the historic figure.  Further the older ‘A’ model which was limited
to using the Aim-7 Sparrow missile is being upgraded to the ‘C’ model
which can use the much more capable Aim-120 AMRAAM missile. Later ‘C’
models (delivered from 1989) are equipped with improved night attack
capabilities.

In the Northern Fury world there are some alterations to historical
production detailed here:

  - Procurement of F/A-18A & B (2 seat) models was extended slightly to
    acquire 70 additional airframes for a total of 480.

  - Procurement of F/A-18C & D (2 seat) models was extended with an
    additional 320 ordered and 50 delivered by the start of Northern
    Fury for a total of 440 so far. The remainder, bringing the total to
    760 will be delivered by the end of 1996.

  - Procurement of USMC F/A-18D (N) – Night attack capable with the rear
    seat configured for a Weapon & Sensor Officer (WSO) remained steady
    at 96

  - Therefore, instead of 896 airframes (410 ‘A’ + 390 ‘C’ + 96 ‘C(N)’),
    Northern Fury starts with 1,016 F/A-18s. (+70 ‘A’, +50 ‘C’ models)

  - The additional production enabled the early retirement of the A-6E
    by the end of 1994

  - Foreign production of CF-18 (Canada), AF-18 (Australia), EF-18
    (Spain) and F/A-18C for Kuwait are complete.

  - Foreign orders for Switzerland and South Korea are ongoing.

  - Foreign order for Finland has not been entertained.

  - F/A-18C & D production generally proceeded as originally planned,
    allowing the flow through of A models to the USMC and Reserve.

  - Ongoing refit of older production ‘A’ models to ‘C’ models is
    ongoing at the rate of 12/month and includes life extension.

  - Upgrade from later production ‘A’ model to the ‘C’ model, less life
    extension but enabling the use of AMRAAMs requires a software and
    minor hardware changes.
