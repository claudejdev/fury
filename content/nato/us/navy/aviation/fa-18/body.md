***F/A-18 Hornet***

The F/A-18 was fast turning into a success story for the USN but the
initial ‘A’ model was a bit of a compromise.  It was not as good as the
F-14 in the Air to Air role, and it did not have the bomb load or range
of the A-6’s or A-7’s it was supposed to replace.  Nonetheless, it was
modern, agile, quicker to repair and much cheaper to operate than the
F-14, more importantly it was capable of fulfilling multiple roles. The
airframe was also an international sales success with Canada, Australia,
Spain and Kuwait already operating it and several others in
negotiations.

The ramp up in tensions equated to an extension of F/A-18 production to
equip an additional CVW and ensure there were enough capable airframes
available.  In total Northern Fury has 10 additional VFA (USN Fighter
Attack) squadrons and the USMC has 5 additional VMFA (USMC Fighter
Attack) squadrons. Total production of F/A-18’s is up by 120 airframes
over the historic figure.  Further the older ‘A’ model which was limited
to using the Aim-7 Sparrow missile is being replaced by the ‘C’ model
which can use the much more capable Aim-120 AMRAAM missile.

In the Northern Fury world there are some alterations to historical
production facts:

  - F/A-18A & B (2 seat) models was extended slightly to acquire 70
    additional airframes for a total of 480

  - F/A-18C & D (2 seat) models was extended with an additional 320
    ordered and 50 delivered by the start of Northern Fury. Remainder to
    be delivered by the end of 1996.

  - Instead of 896 airframes, Northern Fury starts with 1,016 F/A-18s.
    (+70 ‘A’, +50 ‘C’ models)

  - Additional production was to enable the early retirement of the A-6E
    by the end of 1994

  - Foreign production of CF-18 (Canada), AF-18 (Australia), EF-18
    (Spain) and F/A-18C for Kuwait were complete.

  - Foreign orders for Switzerland and South Korea are ongoing.

  - Foreign order for Finland has not been entertained.

  - F/A-18C & D production generally proceeded as originally planned,
    allowing the flow through of A models to the USMC and Reserve

  - Ongoing refit of ‘A’ models to ‘C’ models is ongoing at the rate of
    12/month

  - Upgrade from early versions of the ‘C’ model to enable the use of
    AMRAAMs requires a software and minor hardware
changes.
