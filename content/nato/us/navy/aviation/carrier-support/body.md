**Carrier Support Aircraft**

The 4 aircraft types that round out the CVW on any aircraft carrier
perform vital functions which enable the entire CVBG to survive and
fight much more effectively.

[***E-2C
Hawkeye***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_E-2_Hawkeye)

***This aircraft is the Navy’s AWACs (Airborne Warning and Control)
aircraft.  Each CVW has a squadron of 4 of these highly capable
aircraft. In Northern Fury 5 additional Hawkeye’s were needed for the
additional CVW and this was achieved by maintaining older ‘Group 0’
aircraft in service until further ‘Group II’ become available. The end
goal is to have 75 available to the fleet by
1998.***

[**C-2A-R
Greyhound**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman_C-2_Greyhound)

Although not the ‘Sexiest’ role in a CVW; Carrier Onboard Delivery or
COD, is critical to the functioning of every CVBG.  The C-2 Greyhound is
built on the same airframe as the E-2C Hawkeye and is the overworked
‘Pack Mule’ of the fleet, carrying high priority cargo, casualties,
passengers and mail to and from the CVBG. The ‘R’ in the designation
represents ‘Re-procured’ as the 39 aircraft built in the late 80’s, look
very similar to those they replaced, but they were in fact much
improved. All of the C-2A-R’s belong to two VRC squadrons, one on each
coast and a detachment of 2 Greyhounds is normally attached to each
deployed CVW.  There are 14 original C-2A’s in
storage.

[**EA-6B
Prowler**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_EA-6B_Prowler)

**The EA-6B Prowler was an Electronic Warfare (EW) platform that could
detect, classify, localize, supress and jam enemy electronic emissions.
Equipped with jamming pods, or High-speed Anti-Radiation Missiles (HARM)
or both, this aircraft was ideal for escorting strike packages in order
to conduct Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) missions, protecting
other aircraft from enemy defensive Surface to Air Missiles (SAM) or
detection by radar. A squadron of 4 or sometimes 5 of these valuable
aircraft were part of each
CVW.**

[**S-3B Viking**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_S-3_Viking)

The S-3B Viking is an excellent ASW platform with modern electronics,
computers and GPS navigation – a first for 1994. The S-3 platform is so
versatile it has been adapted to the ES-3A Shadow detailed below, a
cargo version (US-3A), a dedicated tanker (KS-3A- not adopted), the
**Aladdin** for ground surveillance (6), and for several experimental
designs such as **Gray Wolf** with multi-mode ISR systems, or the
**Beartrap** ELINT versions. Therefore, this aircraft type is in high
demand, so much so that the USN experimented with reducing the Squadron
size from 10 to 6, but were forced to bring it up to 8 by 1991. There
are simply not enough airframes however, and the constant demands mean
that there are absolutely no spare Vikings in the fleet.

[**ES-3A Shadow**](https://fas.org/irp/program/collect/es-3_shadow.htm)

Another derivative of the S-3 is the highly successful ES-3A which was
converted from the original S-3A airframes to fulfill the role of
**ELINT** or Electronic Intelligence gathering.  Only 16 of these
aircraft exist and they were produced between 1990 and 1992.  VQ-5 ‘Sea
Shadows’ and VQ-6 ‘Black Ravens’ each fly 8 of these highly specialized
aircraft, normally sending a pair to each deployed
CVW.
