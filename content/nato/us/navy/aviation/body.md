**Naval Aviation**

The late 80’s and early 90’s were a difficult time for US Naval
Aviation.  Many of the older types were becoming obsolete or out dated
(A-6, F-14), and their replacement projects had been cancelled, such as
the A-12 strike replacement for the A-6 and the Super Tomcat 21. Even
programs to improve current airframes were in trouble such as the A-6F
Intruder II and A-6G upgrade. Therefore, the Navy was approaching the
mid 90’s with no new fighter aircraft on the horizon. Relying instead on
moving to single fleet of F/A-18s using the new AMRAAM air to air
missile by 1998/99.

Technology was providing some improvement elsewhere however – the
S-3B, introduced in the mid 80’s was a technological paradigm shift from
the S-3A, and the latest E-2C’s were proving to be exceptional. 
Augmented by a new generation of patrol aircraft, the P-3C; this fleet
of surveillance aircraft were using the rapidly advancing power of
computers to quickly and accurately categorize targets and showed the
way ahead for providing situational awareness to a Task Force commander.

More good news was available with the new generation of Helicopters –
the SH-60 family was developing into a resounding success. This single
airframe was able to replace smaller (SH-2 Seasprite) and larger (SH-3
Sea King) models which were becoming obsolete or simply incapable of
using the latest weapons. The Seahawk was a rare aircraft that could
satisfy operators, maintainers and budget keepers all at once.

**Northern Fury**

Northern Fury finds the USN in the process of rapidly retiring the A-6
fleet, only two carriers still have a strike squadron. Starting in 1996
the plan is to start retiring the F-14s. By 1998 the first Carrier Air
Wings (CVW) of purely F/A-18s is to be fielded, a situation that has
many admirals quite upset and crying for more advanced capability and
flexability.

The resurgence of the Soviet block caused even more turmoil in naval
aviation. Executive orders from the President and a hawkish Congress
demanded that aircraft carriers be retained, so an urgent need arose to
maintain sufficient naval aviation to equip 12 CVW. The extra wing would
allow four wings to be held at high readiness (2 on each coast), four in
a rapidly deployable posture, and four more in training.  Even this
meant that 3 of the 15 carriers called for in the 600 ship navy, would
not have air wings, since one carrier is always in dry-dock and one more
in a multi-month maintenance period, this left one carrier without
aircraft.  To satisfy this requirement, the US Congress agreed to fund a
13th CVW. The plan for CVN-74 when it entered service later in 1994 was
to resume rotating air wings as the USN reverted to routine refit
program.  As the events of the campaign unfold however, this does not
happen and adjustments need to be made.
