**USN Command Ships**

The United States Navy is a massive organization with ships and aircraft
plying every corner of the globe. To control this organization from one
or two static locations would be difficult and demanding, plus risk
nuclear obliteration in the event of a doomsday scenario. Therefore, a
Command and Control network was established based on numbered Fleets.

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/command-ships/image1.png)This is a
snapshot view of Fleet Areas of Responsibility (AOR) in the late 90’s
and up to about 2011 and represents the reduction after the end of the
Cold War (Blue). In the Northern Fury world, a slightly more historic
disposition is represented so this map is only representational.

The key Northern Fury differences (Red) are: 2<sup>nd</sup> Fleet’s AOR
includes all of the North Atlantic north of the Tropic of Cancer.
3<sup>rd</sup> Fleets AOR is unchanged. 4<sup>th</sup> Fleet is
responsible for everything south of the Tropic of Cancer including the
west coast of Africa and from Cape Town South Africa south to
Antarctica. 5<sup>th</sup> Fleets AOR starts at Cape Town and includes
east to the Malay Barrier and the west coast of Australia 6<sup>th</sup>
Fleet is responsible only for the Mediterranean and Black Sea area.
7<sup>th</sup> Fleet will focus north of the Malay Barrier and from
Darwin Australia (inclusive) eastward.

In order to command these widely dispersed fleets the USN uses
Headquarters which are ‘Afloat’ in Command Ships, which are much more
capable then a traditional ‘Flag Ship’. These ships are either purpose
built ([LCC](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/lcc-19.htm) –
Amphibious Command Ship) or converted from other types (AGF –
Miscellaneous Command Ship). In the days when digital communication was
in its infancy, computing power was archaic [compared to
today](http://www.relativelyinteresting.com/comparing-todays-computers-to-1995s/)
- these ships were the most advanced communications platforms in the
world.

Numbered fleets were routinely commanded by a Vice Admiral (3\*), or
Rear Admiral (Upper half) (2\*). 2<sup>nd</sup> Fleet, headquartered in
Norfolk Virginia was double tasked as commanding all NATO forces in the
North Atlantic in times of War – Commander Striking Fleet Atlantic
(**COMSTRIKFLTLANT**) was always a
3\*.

Fleet**: Commanded from Norfolk Virginia in peacetime but its ‘Afloat’
HQ is on board USS Mount Whitney
([LCC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Mount_Whitney_\(LCC-20\))).

**3<sup>rd</sup> Fleet**: Permanently located ashore at San Diego
California.

**4<sup>th</sup> Fleet**: Permanently located ashore at Tampa Bay
Florida

Fleet**: After deactivating after its heroic World War Two actions,
5<sup>th</sup> Fleet was reactivated to control activity in the Indian
Ocean, Persian Gulf and Red Sea areas in Dec of 1993 (July 1995
historically). With an HQ in Bahrain, sharing the Royal Navy Base at HMS
Jufair in the port of Manama. In order to maintain mobility and
communications the Command Ship USS Coronado
([AGF-11](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/agf-11.htm)) has deployed
to be the Flagship of 5<sup>th</sup> Fleet. The Coronado was originally
an Austin Class Amphibious Platform Dock (LPD).

**6<sup>th</sup> Fleet**: With an HQ in Naples and a major logistic
operation at Rota Spain, 6<sup>th</sup> Fleet is responsible for the
Mediterranean and Black Seas. This HQ is double hatted as NATO’s Naval
Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe (STRIKFORSOUTH), and in war
will coordinate the activity of all NATO naval activity in the region.
The ‘Afloat’ Command Ship is USS La Salle
([AGF-3](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/agf-3.htm)) which has just
competed a major refit and assumed these duties on 1 Jan 94 (10 months
earlier than she did historically).

**7<sup>th</sup> Fleet:** With the only permanently forward deployed
Aircraft Carrier Battle Group (CVBG) and Marine Expeditionary Force
(MEF), 7<sup>th</sup> Fleet is located in Yokosuka, Japan. With
responsibility for all of the Pacific Ocean west of the International
Date Line, South Korea, Australia, Japan and including the Malay
Barrier, this is the largest deployed USN force. The Command Ship is USS
Blue Ridge
([LCC-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Blue_Ridge_\(LCC-19\)))

![](/assets/images/nato/us/navy/command-ships/image6.jpeg)**Communications**:
One of the key aspects of Command and Control (C2) is Communications
(C3) and to assist in this regard the USN has two Squadrons of [E-6A
Mercury](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/c3i/e-6.htm) aircraft. These are
heavily modified Boeing 707’s operated by Fleet Reconnaissance Squadron
3 and 4 (VQ-3 & VQ-4) each with eight aircraft located Tinker Air Force
Base in Oklahoma. These aircraft are part of the TACAMO (Take Charge And
Move Out) program to ensure communications between the National Command
Authority and the fleet Ballistic missile submarines. However, the
communications on board these aircraft fulfill a much wider role and
enable global secure communications to the fleet. At least two of these
aircraft are airborne at any time, day or night, 365 days a year.
