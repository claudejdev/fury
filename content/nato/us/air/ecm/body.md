**USAF Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) and Battle management aircraft**

[**EF-111
Raven**](http://www.military-today.com/aircraft/ef111_raven.htm)

The universal nickname for this aircraft is the ‘Spark Vark’ because it
was the electronic warfare version of the F-111 Aardvark. From the mid
’80s onward these aircraft were designed to accompany strike packages
and jam or confuse enemy radars and electronic systems. Equipped with
the same AN/ALQ-99 electronic warfare system that the US Navy uses, it
can intercept process and jam signals from radio and radar, as well as
detect, identify and direction find those signals and provide signals
intelligence (SIGINT), all of this either automatically or manually. The
USAF converted 42 F-111A strike bombers to this role between 1981 and
1983 and upgraded them with an Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) [by
1994](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/f-111.htm). Historically there
was much shuffling the Spark-Varks about in 1993/94 but in Northern Fury
the three Electronic Combat Squadrons (ECS) have remained in place.

[**F-4G Wild Weasel**](http://www.ausairpower.net/TE-Weasel.html)

One of the last key roles in the amazing career of the F-4 Phantom was
that of hunting and killing enemy air defence systems. The Wild Weasel
role is described well in the link, and the F-4G practically wrote the
book on SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defences). Equipped with
AN/APR-38 RHAW (Radar Homing and Warning System) and HARMs (High-Speed
Anti-Radiation Missile), the F-4G can find, suppress and destroy enemy
ground based Surface to Air (SAM) missile radars. This very specialized
role was in the process of being handed over to F-16 Block 50 squadrons
in 1994 but two Squadrons of F-4Gs remain, 561<sup>st</sup> FS the
original ‘Wild Weasels’ and 190<sup>th</sup> ‘Skull Bangers’ ANG
Squadron, each fly 24 aircraft and there are several dozen replacements
available from reserve.

[**EC-130**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/ec-130e.htm)

This section presents two versions of the EC-130 Hercules one of them is
a dedicated ECM aircraft, and the other a Battlespace management
aircraft.

[EC-130H Compass
Call](http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104550/ec-130h-compass-call/)

These are dedicated wide area offensive and defensive ECM aircraft which
support operations by disrupting, tracking and interpreting electronic
signals. In 1994, there are 13 of these aircraft in service across two
squadrons, three more are on order with one entering service in July 94.
They are routinely deployed around the world in detachments of one or
two to support specific operations.

[EC-130E
ABCCC](http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Magazine%20Documents/1999/July%201999/0799abccc.pdf)

These Airborne Battlefield Command and Control Center (ABCCC) aircraft
enabled Command and Control of large air or ground operations. They had
a 40 foot ‘capsule’ or ‘pod’ in the cargo bay which contained over 20
radio systems allowing the full time monitoring of AWACS or J-STARS
feed, communications with air and ground units gave the commander a
near-real time understanding of the battle space. Developed in Viet Nam,
only seven of these aircraft remained in operation by 1994, operated by
7<sup>th</sup> Airborne Command and Control Squadron (ACCS) which
remained at Keesler AFB. In Northern Fury they did not move to Offutt
AFB as their transition to the EC-135 does not occur.

[EC-135 Looking Glass](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/c3i/ec-135.htm)

Since February of 1961, these converted Boeing 707s have maintain [a
24/7 airborne
alert](https://seanmunger.com/2016/02/03/bird-of-doom-the-endless-nuclear-vigil-of-the-looking-glass/)
with at least one aircraft in the air at all times, now 33 years later
they still do so. They did not adopt a ground alert status in 1990 as
they historically did. These aircraft are the fail-safe method of
launching a retaliatory nuclear strike. Although over the three decades
39 aircraft were used in this role, only 12 are operated by
2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Airborne Command and Control Squadrons
(ACCS) at a time. Until the closure of SAC, the Looking Glass Wings had
dedicated tankers; however, this role has been transferred to AMC for
general tanker support.
