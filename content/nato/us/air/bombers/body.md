**USAF Bombers**

The three main types of bombers are key to the US nuclear deterrent, but
in recent years have also become important in the conventional strike
role. Ranging in age from 35-year-old B-52G’s to brand new B-2 Spirit
only entering service in the past few weeks and months, the bomber force
is as diverse as it is powerful.

The eight newly minted B-2 Spirit bombers have been rushed into service
and formed the 393<sup>rd</sup> Bomb Squadron at Whiteman AFB. Two of
the eight aircraft are still being used as testbeds to finalize systems
calibration and procedures. The remaining aircraft are kept busy
qualifying crews and fine tuning attack procedures. The high degree of
stealth, advanced avionics and automated systems, long range and large
bombload make this aircraft very potent. Aircraft in the squadron tend
to fly singly on missions and have not yet qualified on multi-aircraft
night penetration tasks, some argue that there is no need to do so and
that a single bomber is powerful enough on its own. Aircraft on the
squadron are listed below and the next one off the assembly line (Spirit
of Nebraska) is expected in March 94 with another roughly every 2-3
months after that until all 21 are delivered:

-   AV-5 Spirit of Ohio ATEC Testbed

-   AV-6 Spirit of Mississippi ATEC Testbed

-   AV-7 Spirit of Texas

-   AV-8 Spirit of Missouri

-   AV-9 Spirit of California

-   AV-10 Spirit of South Carolina

-   AV-11 Spirit of Washington

-   AV-12 Spirit of Kansas

[**B-1B Lancer**](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/bomber/b-1b.htm)

Nicknamed the ‘Bone’ (B-ONE), 95 of the original 100 airframes remain in
service. These supersonic bombers have variable swept wings and a
blended wing body with four massive engines. It was designed to be a
Mach 2+ nuclear delivery system; however, when production aircraft
started entering service in 1985 they were limited in speed to Mach 1.25
(950 mph or 1,530 kph) in order to increase efficiency and avoid
structural damage. After production, their role changed due to the high
level SAM threat, their low level speed which was increased to Mach 0.92
(700 mph, 1,130 kph) combined with the use of an advanced terrain
following radar made them a formidable low level penetrator, at the time
however they were still only able to use nuclear munitions. Their high
speed, advanced sensors, avionics and electronic countermeasures made
this a much more survivable aircraft than the B-52, which it was
replacing in the nuclear strike and deterrence role. A limited ability
to drop conventional munitions was added in 1990 and with the downfall
of SAC (Strategic Air Command), the bombers were transferred to ACC (Air
Combat Command) who had a much greater interest in using these platforms
in conventional fights. They did not participate in the Gulf War due to
limitations on use caused by engine fires, which has since been
rectified. By 1994 the ‘Bones’ could drop general purpose and cluster
munitions from both low and high altitude, but were unable to use
precision guided munitions. Two wings of B-1Bs operate the majority of
the airframes for ACC as well as the 46<sup>th</sup> Bomb squadron which
conducts training, testing and evaluation for ATEC.

[**B-52**](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/bomber/b-52.htm)

The venerable B-52 Stratofortress, the mainstay of SAC’s bombing force
for three decades was more commonly known as the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat …
Fella), and was universally recognized around the world as a symbol of
American military power. Of the 744 produced over 10 years in eight
major versions, only about 200 of the latest models remain in service.
Still serving in four bomb wings are 99 of the original 102 B-52H models
and 96 of the original 193 B-52G. There are about 90 ‘G’ models in
storage, tentatively awaiting destruction due to the START I (Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty) settlement, which was agreed with the previous
Soviet government and neither renounced nor ratified by either side
after the Soviet Coup of ‘91. The fundamental difference between the ‘G’
and the ‘H’ are the engines which are much more powerful and efficient
as well as improved tail gun, avionics, targeting and electronic
countermeasures (ECM) in the ‘H’. More ‘G’ models were retained in
service than was historically the case due to uncertainty in the START
negotiations, but both models were being modified to be more
conventionally capable by ACC. The ‘G’ model could engage shipping
targets with the AGM-84D Harpoon missile while the ‘H’ models were
fitted with the AGM-86C CALCM (Conventional Land Attack Cruise Missile),
both were undergoing a constant series of ECM upgrades. The B-52 played
a significant role in the Gulf War, some flying from the US and
returning home, capturing the record for longest distance combat mission
from the British ‘Black Buck’ missions executed during the Falkland
Islands campaign.
