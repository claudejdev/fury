**Reconnaissance/Early Warning Aircraft**

[**SR-71 Blackbird**](https://fas.org/irp/program/collect/sr-71.htm)

This iconic aircraft was historically retired in 1990 due to funding and
other issues, in Northern Fury that does not happen and they were
retained in service, two additional aircraft were still provided to NASA
as was done in 1991. One modification to the Northern Fury SR-71s is the
addition of a data-link, enabling quicker use of intelligence gathered.
In 1994, with four aircraft with NASA, there were 16 Blackbirds
available in the USAF but only seven with low flight hours (under 2,000
hrs), and two with very high hours (over [3,000
hours](https://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/)). All SR-71s were operated by
1<sup>st</sup> Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (SRS) based at Beale
AFB with detachments at Kadena Japan and RAF Mildenhall in the UK. The
Squadron is part of 9<sup>th</sup> Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (SRW).
So in Northern Fury, 1<sup>st</sup> SRS operates eight Blackbirds for
operational missions including at least one in each of the detachment
locations, the other airframes are used for training, are in long term
maintenance or storage, or are simply retired.

[**U2/TR-1 Dragon Lady**](https://fas.org/irp/program/collect/u-2.htm)

This variable lady has been around since the 1950s but keeps improving
with age. By 1994 the conversion/merger of the strategic reconnaissance
version (U-2R) and the tactical reconnaissance version (TR-1) is largely
complete and the 9<sup>th</sup> SRW is operating an (almost) homogenous
fleet of 32 U-2S aircraft, with 5 additional 2-seat trainers. These
aircraft are configurable with a bewildering array of sensors which are
detailed in the main link and also

(some of which came after 1994). The link gives some fascinating
examples (at the unclassified level) of what the aircraft is capable of.

[**RC-135 Rivet
Joint**](https://fas.org/irp/program/collect/rivet_joint.htm)

The Rivet Joint is a Boeing 707 based electronic surveillance aircraft
which collects data on enemy communications systems and passes it on to
land based intelligence analysis squadrons. The systems carried by the
RC-135 are complex and highly classified, but it can assist in locating
and identifying almost any platform which is emitting an electronic
signature. The 14 aircraft of this type operating in 1994 were based at
Offutt AFB, NE by the 55<sup>th</sup> Reconnaissance Squadron (RS), with
four aircraft stationed at RAF Mildenhall in the UK operating with
95<sup>th</sup> SRS as the 95<sup>th</sup> RS.

[**E-8 Joint
STARS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_E-8_Joint_STARS)

The E-8 is a joint Army/Air Force project to provide area surveillance
and battle management systems for the ground commander. Conceived in the
early ‘80s, there were two prototype
[E-8A](https://fas.org/irp/program/collect/jstars.htm) J-STARS flown in
the Gulf War to great success. Production of 16 E-8C J-STARS is ongoing
and due to deliver later in 1995, in the meantime, for Northern Fury,
two additional C-135 (Boeing 707) have been converted and the
93<sup>rd</sup> Air Control Wing (ACW) and the 12<sup>th</sup> Airborne
Command and Control Squadron (ACCS) has been stood up to operate the
four aircraft out of Robins AFB, GA.

[**E-3 Sentry**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/e-3.htm)

Probably the most recognizable aircraft on the planet, the E-3 Sentry or
AWACS (Airborne Early Warning and Control System) was developed in the
‘70s and undergoes constant upgrade and improvement. These reliable
(Boeing 707 based) workhorses allow air commanders to control and
coordinate /assets within a massive volume of airspace. The 32 American
examples are augmented by NATO’s 18, Britain’s 6, France’s 4, and Saudi
Arabia’s 5 aircraft, providing a widely integrated understanding of the
air picture wherever US or allied forces are deployed in the world.
These aircraft are used throughout the world and are able to rapidly
deploy, usually from Tinker AFB, the home base where several AACS
(Airborne Air Control Squadrons) are located.

[**RF-4C Phantom**](https://fas.org/irp/program/collect/rf-4.htm)

One of the last versions of the venerable F-4 Phantom to remain flying
in the USAF, and indeed the world was the Reconnaissance variant. As an
unarmed photo-reconnaissance aircraft the Phantom was able to cruise at
high level and then conduct high speed low level missions, develop the
photographic film onboard and pass it for immediate interpretation on
landing – a system of dropping the film canisters proved unreliable in
Viet Nam and that method was discarded. The USAF experimented with using
both the F-15 and F-16 as reconnaissance platforms but decided against
it and adopted reconnaissance pods to be attached to them when required.
Some A-10 Warthogs have been modified to act as Forward Air Control
(FAC) aircraft but they retain all other capabilities of the A-10 so are
covered in that section. The Phantom performed exceptionally well in the
Gulf War, and three Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons (TRS) remain in
Northern Fury, slightly longer than they did in the real world.
