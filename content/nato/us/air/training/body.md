**USAF Training aircraft**

[**T-41 Mescalero**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/t-41.htm)

![](/assets/images/nato/us/air/training/image1.jpg)This military
version of the Cessna 172 was used by the USAF to determine a student’s
suitability for further flight training. This was called the Flight
Screening Program (FSP), and was conducted by a contracted company at
Hondo Airfield, Texas. Each officer candidate would spend 14 hours of
flight training in the T-41 prior to being accepted into flight school.
The program was conducted under the auspices of 12 Air Training Wing at
Randolph AFB. About 200 aircraft were engaged in this task at any time
as well as another 50 more powerful T-41C held at the Air Force Academy
in Colorado. The T-41-Cs were to provide officer candidates at the
Academy a further 21 hours of flight training under a similar contract
arrangement. The Army also operated another 255 T-41B in training and
liaison duties.

**Note**: Neither the T-3 or the T-6 were available at the time of
Northern Fury.

[**T-37B Tweet**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/t-37.htm)

![](/assets/images/nato/us/air/training/image2.jpg)The T-37 is the
basic jet trainer used by the USAF and many other air forces. The main
function of the aircraft is to train pilots and navigators in the
fundamentals of flight, navigation, instrumentation, night and formation
flying. This aircraft introduces students to the handling and
characteristics of jet aircraft before they move into either the T-38 or
the T-1A. Over 1,000 were produced for the USAF and about 580 remain in
service in 1994, all are T-37B and used by 12 Flight Training Squadrons
(FTS). The heavily modified T-37C can be armed and is in use by various
air forces around the world as was the A-37 Super Tweet used extensively
by the USAF in Viet
Nam.

Talon**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/t-38.htm)

The Talon is an advanced jet trainer and students move onto this
aircraft from the T-37 if they are going into fighters, strike or bomber
aircraft. Many air forces use the T-38 in the training role, and several
NATO countries train their pilots in the US both on this aircraft and on
the T-37 through the NATO Joint Jet Pilot training program hosted at
Sheppard AFB. Some of the T-38s are modified to the AT-38B standard with
external weapons mounts in order to train pilots in weapons release. The
Test Pilot School at Edwards AFB uses the T-38 to qualify its students,
and all commands in the USAF as well as NASA use this versatile aircraft
for various roles. Over 1,100 Talons were produced for the USAF and in
1994 there are about 600 remaining in service, with around 500 available
for flight
training.

Jayhawk**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/t-1.htm)

The Jayhawk came into the USAF in 1992 and began training pilots for the
airlift and tanker fleets in early 1993. Both US Navy and USMC pilots
requiring multi-engine jet qualifications are trained by the USAF on
these same squadrons. Programed for 180 aircraft, about 80 had been
delivered by the end of 1993. New aircraft are arriving at a rate of two
per month and will be distributed evenly until the training squadrons
reach a strength of 36
each.

The T-43 is a modified Boeing 737 used primarily for navigation training
and prepared navigators and other crew for duty in strategic and
tactical platforms such as Looking Glass, E-3 Sentry or J-STARS. Of the
15 aircraft in the inventory 12 are used by 562<sup>nd</sup> ‘Gators’
and 563<sup>rd</sup> ‘Ace of Spades’ Squadrons as part of
12<sup>th</sup> Air Training Wing at Randolph AFB, Texas. The remaining
three are used for general transport
duties.

by the 9<sup>th</sup> Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale AFB,
California. Four of the original five aircraft exist and they are
modified and updated to the latest versions.
