**USAF Strike Aircraft**

The primary purpose of these aircraft are to deliver ordinance onto
enemy targets, these targets can range from the very tactical, such as a
tank or bunker up to the strategic level, such as the strike targeting
Libya’s dictator Muammar Kaddafi in 1986. Alternatively, some references
refer to these platforms as ‘Attack’ aircraft.

[**F-117 Nighthawk**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/f-117.htm)The
‘Stealth Fighter’ had its combat debut in Panama, but came into its
own during the Gulf war where 36 of them were deployed. These aircraft
are the first to use low observable technology and rely on their stealth
to penetrate deep into enemy territory and conduct precision strikes
with laser guided bombs. Based at Holloman AFB in New Mexico the
49<sup>th</sup> Fighter Wing fields two operational squadrons and a
conversion training squadron. In total 59 aircraft were produced but
only 52 of them are
operational.

[**F-111F Aardvark**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/f-111.htm)

The F-111 has a controversial history but proved its worth as a long
range deep strike bomber during the Persian Gulf war and before that
when bombing targets in Libya. This is high speed, long range, swept
wing design with avionics that were very advanced when the ‘Varks’ were
fielded in the 1960s. The FB-111 nuclear strike versions have been
retired leaving two wings of tactical bombers, 38<sup>th</sup> Tactical
Fighter Wing in the UK with the F-111E and the much improved F-111F in
the 27<sup>th</sup> Tactical Fighter Wing at Cannon
AFB.

[**A-10/OA-10 Thunderbolt
II**](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/a-10.htm)

This aircraft is not generally known by its official name but is
universally called the ‘Warthog’. The A-10 is rugged, adaptable and
survivable, but most importantly it is deadly. Specifically designed to
conduct Close Air Support (CAS) missions in the dangerous and difficult
area between friendly and enemy ground troops, the A-10 carries up to
16,000 lbs of ordinance and a 30mm Gatling gun. A derivative of the A-10
is the OA-10 which constitutes about 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the fleet and
is designed to be an airborne Forward Air Controller (FAC) used to guide
other aircraft onto targets, otherwise it has all the same capabilities
as the A-10 and looks very similar. The ‘Hogs’ have seen extensive
active service in the Balkans and the Gulf War. Some extensive
reshuffling has occurred with these squadrons since the Gulf War but 21
squadrons remain in service including 5 ANG and 2 Air
Reserve.

[**A-7D Corsair II**](http://www.aircraftinformation.info/art_A7.htm)

This aircraft was supposed to be retired in 1993 after 25 years in USAF
service, and even longer service in the USN and USMC. Commonly known as
the SLUF (Short Little Ugly …Fella), the other name for this workhorse
was ‘Bomb Truck’ because of its ability to carry about 20,000 lbs worth
of ordinance. The ‘D’ versions were passed on the ANG starting 1973 and
by the mid ‘80s were exclusively flown the Air Guard as the A-10s filled
regular squadrons. Although 459 of this version were produced they now
only equip three ANG Squadrons in Tucson, Arizona. All of the remaining
aircraft have had the LANA (Low Altitude Night Attack) upgrade and have
Pave Penny laser targeting pods. (72 instead of the actual 47 were
converted).
