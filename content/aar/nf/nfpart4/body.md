**Northern Fury Part 4: To the edge of Armageddon**

The war is now six weeks old, and NATO has halted the Soviet advance in
Norway. The final battleset in this campaign starts with the
commencement of the NATO counterattack and ends with the conclusion of
the war. NATO choses to use its operational mobility and technological
advantage in certain areas to bypass Soviet operational strengths in
ground forces and geography.
