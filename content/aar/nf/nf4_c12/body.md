**<u>Northern Fury \#4 â€“ A Cold and Lonely Place</u>**

**<u>AAR by Coiler12, Mar 2014</u>**

So I played this desperate defense from the NATO side, and threw my
forces hard into it. Almost immediately after seeing the first Forgers
incoming and hearing the report about the Soviet "Cargo ship", I
immediately threw my planes into the air. My aerial /assets at Jan Mayen
were four F-5A's (two with Sidewinders and two with Bullpups), and a
P-3.

-The initial aerial duel went strongly in my favor, with the hapless
Yak-38s getting splashed by my F-5s. My P-3 located the Azov and the
Bullpup F-5s attacked it. Although it was badly damaged and the
helicopter onboard destroyed, the Azov remained afloat and trundled
towards Jan Mayen. That was the high water mark of my resistance.

-The large Tu-16 raid came in, and even though the Sidewinder F-5s
brought one down, they devastated the base. I had the good sense to send
my Bullpup F-5s back to Iceland, yet their Sidewinder counterparts
landed and were trapped after the runway was destroyed, sealing their
fate.

-My diesel sub near the island was detected by a sonobuoy and
immediately blown up. My Los Angeles SSN was slightly more successful-I
found the Kiev group and tossed a few Harpoons at one of the outer
skunks, which turned out to be a Krivak, sinking it. Unfortunately,
diving deep to continue the attack did not work, and an SS-N-14 sent my
sub to the bottom.

-The Yak-141's just circled the fishing boats but did not fire. (This
may be a posture issue, note to Gunner98.) After the airdrop onto Jan
Mayen and the loss of my SSN, I sent the P-3 back to Iceland as well.
After that, the enemy took over the island and that was that.
