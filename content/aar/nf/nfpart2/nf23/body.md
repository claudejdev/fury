You are the **CO of the Force Recon Battalion of 2<sup>nd</sup> MEF**
(Marine Expeditionary Force) and you will be leading a risky para drop
onto Iceland tonight. If all goes well, you will link up with the
landing elements of the two assaulting Marine Regiments by this time
tomorrow. A quick scan of the Drop Zone names however, reminds you that
on operations such as these things don’t always go right!

**<u>Northern Fury \#23</u>** is a medium sized scenario which puts the
player in a difficult position. The defences are not fully neutralized
yet but there is work to be done if the landings are to succeed (next
scenario). Should the player focus on stealth and risk being put into a
very bad position, or should s/he go in all guns blazing to finish of
the bad guys?
