A ceaseless combination of bomber and carrier borne attacks over the
past 72 hours has reduced the defences on Iceland significantly! The
Marine Force Recon element is going in right now and a Battalion landing
team seized the airport at Vestmannaeyjar late yesterday. Your job is to
soften up any defences and support the buildup of the new airbase.

As commander of the Covering Force for the Amphibious assault which
arrives in a few hours, you command two Battleship Task Groups, and for
tonight’s operation you are also protecting the advance element of the
Amphibious Task Force, LPD Shreveport. You have a busy night ahead of
you, targets to shoot at, marines to deliver, supplies to position and
bases to prepare – not many in your force will sleep tonight!

**<u>Northern Fury \#24</u>** puts the player in a preparatory role,
major amphibious assaults don’t just happen, there is a lot of advance
activity that needs to occur, and that is what this scenario is all
about. The main reason the Battalion Landing Team went in yesterday was
to secure the airport at Vestmannaeyjar, now it must be improved and
supplied so helicopters and harriers can operate and support the
landing. Also, the Force Recon elements who are jumping onto the island
will need support and several other areas will need to be watched. Let’s
not forget about the enemy though – he is sure to try something to foil
the overall plan.
