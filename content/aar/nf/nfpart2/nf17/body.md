This is a very small and straight forward scenario which provides an
interesting change from the massive operations that are ongoing. 42
hours ago, your Special Forces team comprising of 4 Canadian JTF2 (Joint
Task Force 2) and 4 British SBS (Special Boat Service) operatives
arrived in Iceland. Now it’s time to earn your paycheck.

**<u>Northern Fury \#17</u>** is a very short exercise in
non-traditional targeting. The /assets in play are also quite
non-traditional for 1994, Special Operations teams and F-117 stealth
fighters.
