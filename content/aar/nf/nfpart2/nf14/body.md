The US 2<sup>nd</sup> Fleet is now ready for its first counterattack.
The 1<sup>st</sup> phase has the USS Eisenhower and the USS Carl Vinson
CVBGs strike at Soviet forces around Iceland.

In order to neutralize the significant Soviet forces on Iceland your
task is to move north and establish local air superiority over the
Keflavik peninsula as a precursor to a large USAF strike tomorrow night.
You have 28 hours to destroy Soviet Air Defences over Iceland. Detailed
SEAD and Strike tasks will be the Air Forces job, but you need to clean
the airspace to make that possible. You know that there are formidable
air defences both on and over Iceland so this will not be an easy task.

**<u>Northern Fury \#14</u>** is the first of five scenarios where NATO
is focused on reducing the defences of Iceland. During this first
attack, the primary opposition will be Soviet fighters, and it is a
formidable defence.
