**Northern Fury Part 2: Counterattack on Iceland**

After one week at war, NATO forces start regaining their footing and
many elements are adapting to a cohesive plan instead of conducting
peacetime duties. After the furious carrier battles to hold Soviet
forces from breaking out into the Atlantic air and sea lanes, it is now
time for NATO to put planed contingencies into effect and start striking
back.

This battleset includes fifteen scenarios where NATO is moving onto the
offensive, endeavoring to whittle down the defences in Iceland and then
