You are tasked with conducting a decisive airstrike with the
**27<sup>th</sup> Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) reinforced**, while
transiting your forces to England. The 27<sup>th</sup> TFW consists of 3
squadrons of F-111 and a supporting squadron of EF-111s ECM aircraft,
for this strike the wing has been reinforced by a squadron each of
F-15C, F-15E, F-16CJ, F-4G Wild Weasel, F-117 Nighthawk and other
supporting forces.

**<u>Northern Fury \#18</u>** is a very difficult scenario. The F-111
which is your major strike asset is an aircraft that is between
generations; far more capable than the Vietnam era aircraft it replaced,
but far less capable of modern 4<sup>th</sup> generation aircraft.
Although it pioneered many new and cutting-edge technologies when it was
delivered in the 1970s, by the 1990s these had long been superseded. In
most situations however, the Aardvark was still a very capable bomber,
unfortunately the defences in place on Iceland do not represent most
situations.
