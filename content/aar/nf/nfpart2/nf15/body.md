This is a small and straight forward scenario. Your task is simple, as
the Captain of the Canadian Submarine HMCS Onondaga, infiltrate Soviet
ASW defences north of Reykjavik and insert a Special Forces team
comprising of 4 Canadian JTF2 (Joint Task Force 2) and 4 British SBS
(Special Boat Service) operatives. However, you may find that in war –
nothing is simple.

**<u>Northern Fury \#15</u>** provides an opportunity for stealth and
patience. Although the Soviet defences are dispersed, they are on
heightened alert and will not be surprised that Special Forces teams
will be coming ashore.
