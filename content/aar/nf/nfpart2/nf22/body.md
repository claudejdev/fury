Strike Fleet Atlantic (STRIKFLTLANT) is now conducting its first major
counterattack. The 1<sup>st</sup> phase was the softening up of Soviet
defences on Iceland which has taken place over the past several days.
Now as a preliminary move to the retaking of Iceland, the Faroe Island
chain must be secured with a primary focus of the Vagar island airport.

You are **Commander of TG Invincible and supported by the French carrier
Clemenceau**, surface, subsurface and amphibious forces as well as land
based air elements. Your task is to unhinge the Soviet defences, protect
reinforcing airborne operations and clear the defenders out of the Faroe
Islands, all while protecting civilian infrastructure and preserving
your force. The Soviets, however, have other ideas.

**<u>Northern Fury \#22</u>** is an interesting scenario using British
and French /assets to conduct an amphibious and airborne operation.
Soviet defences are well prepared but much less potent than those on
Iceland, however the assaulting forces are also much less numerous.
