2<sup>nd</sup> Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF) executed an
amphibious and Heli-borne landing on Iceland two days ago at dawn on the
26<sup>th</sup> of February with two Regimental Landing Teams (RLT),
6<sup>th</sup> Marine RLT along the south coast and 8<sup>th</sup>
Marine RLT on the west coast. The battle is progressing well, air and
sea superiority has allowed the many US ‘Combat Multipliers’ to play,
giving the marines a significant advantage.

The Soviet 76<sup>th</sup> Guards Airborne Division, subjected to days
of air and naval bombardment has ceased to exist as a fighting division
but its regiments maintain some cohesion even after significant
casualties. Split into two parts, the remnants of two regiments are
forming a last-ditch defence in the area of Reykjavik and Keflavik while
in the east of the island the 234<sup>th</sup> Air Assault Regiment is
collecting as many stragglers and heavy weapons systems as it can to
defend the rugged areas east of the American landings.

As Commander of the 6<sup>th</sup> Marine RLT, you are to execute a
contingency operation to disrupt the 234<sup>th</sup> Regiments
operations along the north coast of Iceland.

**<u>Northern Fury \#26</u>** represents an opportunity in a major
operation where a small unit action might turn the tide. The Battalion
Landing Team (BLT) which conducted the coup de-main on the island of
Vestmannaeyjabær is now the MEF reserve force and has been tasked to
seizing that opportunity. But with every opportunity, there is risk.
