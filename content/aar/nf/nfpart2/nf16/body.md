This is a medium size scenario focusing on pushing NATO submarines and
some unique capabilities through the Greenland Sea to the very edge of
the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean. The Soviets consider this area
home waters, and protect the Barents Sea, one of their critical
‘Bastions’, vigorously. In addition to standard sub vs. sub action you
will be required to complete several special missions while the Soviets
hunt for you plentiful and alert air, surface and sub surface forces.

**<u>Northern Fury \#16</u>** has the player conducting a wide variety
of submarine missions from attack patrols, to inserting Special Forces,
to establishing electronic listening stations and tapping into undersea
cables. The main effort of this operation is to further isolate Soviet
forces on Iceland from their supply base in the Kola Peninsula, but much
more is going on. It is not surprising that the Soviets will try very
hard to prevent this from occurring.
