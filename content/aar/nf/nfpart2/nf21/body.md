The US 2<sup>nd</sup> Fleet is now entering the final phase of its first
major counter-attack. A ceaseless combination of bomber and carrier
borne attacks over the past 60 hours has reduced the defences on Iceland
significantly! Now all that is left is the task of sweeping up the last
few targets and preparing the ground for the amphibious assault by the
Marines tomorrow. If you have learned anything this past week; however,
nothing is simple.

You have a very busy day ahead of you which will cause your forces to
split – never a good thing while a competent and resourceful enemy waits
for opportunities to inflict delay and damage. Your main tasks are to:
Destroy any targets that have escaped prosecution so far. Also to
destroy 30-40 bridges dividing the island in thirds, ensuring that the
other, larger bridges are undamaged. Marshal, escort, insert and support
a Marine Bn as it conducts a Coup de Main operation. Sweep the Denmark
Straights of Soviet submarines. Destroy facilities on Jan Mayan Island.
And finally to keep the Soviets at bay, and do so with minimal
casualties. Enjoy!

**<u>Northern Fury \#21</u>** is an extremely busy scenario. The player
has many tasks and many conflicting priorities, also new and unexpected
events will pop up to keep things interesting. The Soviet defences are
now largely disrupted – but not destroyed.
