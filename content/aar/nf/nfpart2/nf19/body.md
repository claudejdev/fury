With two Carrier Battle Groups, you are tasked with conducting precision
strikes to eliminate HQ and C2 facilities on Iceland. After two days of
whittling down the defending fighters on Iceland, the USAF struck last
night to eliminate the Surface to Air Missile (SAM) defences. Now it is
time to take out the Command and Communications elements.

**<u>Northern Fury \#19</u>** provides a chance for some precision
bombing and detailed strike planning. In addition to HQ, you are tasked
with destroying logistics, infrastructure and airbases, the target list
is quite long. Unfortunately, the strikes eliminate air defences were
not completely successful.
