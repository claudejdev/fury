This is a small but critical scenario in the battle to isolate Soviet
forces on Iceland. Since taking the island of Jan Mayen in the first
hours of the war, the desolate spot on the Greenland Sea has become a
critical link in Iceland’s supply chain, a long and arduous link back to
the Kola Peninsula. Your job in this scenario is to cut that tether.

**<u>Northern Fury \#13</u>** is a small Special Forces operation with
fairly conventional opposition. If approached correctly there should be
little difficulty, however if things go wrong – they will go very wrong.
