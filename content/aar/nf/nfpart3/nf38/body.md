It is now time to start strangling the Soviet forces in central and
southern Norway.

You are commanding the USAF’s 336<sup>th</sup> Fighter Squadron – ***The
Rocketeers***, and your mission is to sever the only ground link through
central Norway – the E6 Highway. Several elements of 25<sup>th</sup> Air
Force will be supporting you, in particular SEAD and OCA support from
81<sup>st</sup> Tactical Fighter Wing and some of the heavies from
Scotland, but this is your time to show what your ‘Eagles’ can do. The
Army is under heavy pressure in the Lillehammer area, and we need to cut
the tail of the force attacking them. Timing is a key issue, The Royal
Navy is wrapping up a major operation to draw Soviet attention, this
should leave you a window to get in and get out quickly – before the USN
takes over and takes out the airfields. Your bosses had hoped the Air
Bases would be closed by now – but no such luck; you will need to fight
all the way in, and out…

**<u>Northern Fury \#38</u>** is an exercise in precision bombing using
the very new (for 1994) F-15E. Soviet defences are weakened and
distracted but not defeated.
