In the past 72 hours’ Soviet forces in Division strength have breached
the Trollheimen mountains, the last significant barrier on the approach
to Oslo. With Berlin and Copenhagen in Russian hands, and the Norwegian
army in tatters the North Atlantic Council (NAC) does not want a third
capital city to fall. You, as Commander STRIKFLTLANT have been directed
to use all of your available combat power to stop their offensive and to
set up the conditions for upcoming amphibious operations in Norway.

You have significant force at your disposal, and initiated movement 2
days ago upon receiving direction from SHAPE to conduct this operation.
By acting quickly, you hope to catch the Soviet forces off balance. You
intend to hold them in the south while you attack from the west. Time
however is not your friend, and the Soviets are a lot closer to Oslo
than you are!

**<u>Northern Fury \#35</u>** is a very large scenario where the player
is in charge of four US, two British and one French aircraft carrier
groups as well as large air forces base on land. Although this is a
significant force, it is not overwhelming, and the Soviets have very
deep defences.
