**Northern Fury Part 3: Grinding through Norway**

With Iceland secured NATO forces move towards the next major hurdle in
their path, Norway. In the first two weeks of the war the Soviets have
gained far more of Norway than anticipated, and there is still plenty of
combat power left in the Soviet arsenal. The Blog at this
[link](http://northernfury.us/blog/post23/) shows how the Soviet
**Karelian Front** is organized with the objective to seize all of
Norway. This battleset brings our story to the final phases of the
Soviet offensive and roles through the battles that bring their force to
a halt and eventually put them on the defensive.
