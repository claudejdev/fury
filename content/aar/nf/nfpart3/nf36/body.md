A massive NATO attack two days ago halted Soviet plans to seize Oslo but
with Berlin and Copenhagen in Russian hands, the situation is not yet
assured. The Soviet Ground Commander in Norway has one final shot in his
quiver that will put NATO back on it’s heals and put the Soviets back on
the offensive.

You are commanding 2<sup>nd</sup> Bde, 82<sup>nd</sup> Airborne Division
and have recently been deployed out of Theatre Reserve to Norway in a
last-ditch effort to halt the Soviet advance. Your limited forces are
being hindered by a general shortage of ammunition – it will only get
worse if you fail!

**<u>Northern Fury \#36</u>** is a land centric operation where the
player needs to use /assets available to initiate a JAAT (Joint Air
Attack Team) to stop a large a Soviet armored advance. A JAAT is a
technique where US Army aviation (Attack and observation Helicopters)
supported by artillery and anti-tank fire works closely with USAF strike
aircraft, particularly the A-10 in destroying enemy armor in a
coordinated killing zone.
