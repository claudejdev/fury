In Norway the Soviets seem to have put their assault on hold. With the
main Soviet force on the North side of the Trondheimsfjorden, and the
Norwegians defending south of that major water feature. A stalemate has
set in, but for NATO supplying elements trapped North of the main line
is becoming a problem, however, keeping them there is a thorn in the
side of the Soviets.

This scenario is playable by both sides: It should be fast and furious.

As NATO you will be charged with resupplying the isolated coastal fort
near Orland, it is on the Northern entrance to the Trondheimsfjorden,
and the Soviets need to silence it before their next move. However, it
is running out of ammunition, food and many other essential stores.
There are Soviet mines in the area, and you want to install two
minefields yourself.

As the Soviet player, you are running routine operations to keep NATO
under pressure while the next major push is being prepared. You have
routine patrols the Norwegians at the Orland fort isolate, and counter
mining operations ongoing, there are also Soviet detachments in isolated
and vulnerable locations which need supplies.

It is a clear, cold and – so far – quiet night in Norway.

**<u>Northern Fury \#28</u>** is a small scenario which can become
frantic and at times desperate as both sides strive to complete multiple
tasks with limited resources. Sea mines are a deadly threat to both. The
night is dark and full of terrors!
