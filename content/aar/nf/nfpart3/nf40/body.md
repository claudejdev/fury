final element of **Operation Thor’s Lightning** is to interdict the
ground line of communications and C2 of the Soviet land forces in
Norway. In the overall plan – You are the ‘Tongs’ and have 24 hours to

**<u>Northern Fury \#40</u>** is the final phase in of **Operation
Thor’s Lightning** and reaches the furthest north of any other action so
far. If the Soviet are going to try and interfere, this would be a good
time to do it. Unfortunately, the ‘bean counters’ at Fleet, have started
to realize that continuous operations are chewing through the missile
stockpiles very quickly. That will certainly have an impact on your
operations.
