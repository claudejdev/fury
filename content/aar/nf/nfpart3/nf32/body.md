While a surprise renewal of the Soviet offensive south of Trondheim has
begun, Soviet supply lines are becoming stretched. As the Soviet ground
and air campaign moves south, consuming massive amounts of supplies and
resources, the Rear Services group for Archangel Corps struggles to keep
pace. For much of Norway’s coastline there is a single two lane road
connecting from the Arctic border near Murmansk all the way to
Trondheim, over 2000 Km including an 8Km ferry SW of Narvik.

In order to speed the delivery of supplies, coastal shipping is in
fairly heavy usage. But that is vulnerable – and your job is to prove
just how vulnerable that is.

**<u>Northern Fury \#32</u>** is a very small scenario. The player is in
charge of one submarine, S 305 Uredd, and must sink several merchant
ships. The Soviets expect trouble however.
