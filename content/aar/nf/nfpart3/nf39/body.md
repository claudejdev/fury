You are commanding TF 20.2 centered on two CVBG’s: *Nimitz* and *Carl
Vinson*. You job is to quickly follow a divisionary attack set by the
British (TF 20.3) to your south and strike the Bodo/Evenes/Andoya area
to neutralize those three airbases. In the overall plan – You are the
‘**Anvil’** and have 24 hours to crush your targets. 25<sup>th</sup> Air
Force’s attacks against the Land Lines of Communications (**Hammer**);
which are just completing now should have the defences off balance.
Tomorrow TF 20.1 (Enterprise & Roosevelt) will carry out precision
strikes to your North as ‘**Tongs’** is put into action.

**<u>Northern Fury \#39</u>** is a large scenario where you have two US
aircraft carriers and 24 hours with which to shut down three Soviet
airbases. The defences have been attrited but not destroyed, they remain
a threat to operations.
