**You are commanding the USS Wisconsin Task Group** and are charged with
destroying several coastal fortresses that were built by the Norwegians
to fend off an attack from the sea. The Soviets are now manning these
guns and have expended a reasonable amount of ammunition to become
proficient with them. You also need to insert a Special Forces team
undetected into the mountains near the Swedish border – but most of all
you need to convince the Soviets that we are very interested in this
area.

**<u>Northern Fury \#42</u>** is a small scenario with features a
classic Big Gun Battleship against shore installations harkening back to
bygone days. The scenario happens concurrent with NF \#41 but is a bit
of a sideshow so is much more fun played on its own.
