The new global war between East and West has been raging for a month,
NATO is on the offensive, but the Warsaw Pact is far from defeated and
still has the ability to counterattack. The ground war in Europe
continues to be brutal and deadly, after Berlin and Copenhagen fell, the
Danish Government collapsed but the Germans continue to govern out of
Bonn. Danish air and naval forces are generally still fighting alongside
their NATO counterparts, but they have taken heavy casualties. Aircraft
losses in central Europe count in the thousands, troops in the tens of
thousands on both sides. Over 100 ships and patrol vessels have been
sunk in the Baltic alone.

Commander STRIKFLTLANT has set in motion a series of attacks designed
set up the conditions for upcoming amphibious operations in Norway –
Operation Thor’s Lightning. This is one of those actions.

You are commanding TF 20.3 centered on the two Royal Navy Carriers and a
strong surface force. Along with strong but mixed air support you are
charged with neutralizing the bases of Orland and Vaernes while focusing
Soviet attention. The enemy needs to be looking at you when Thor’s
Hammer falls tomorrow.

**<u>Northern Fury \#37</u>** is challenging scenario where the player
is in the role of commanding a deception force. By there very nature the
tasks given are meant to attract attention, but if successfully
completed will aid future operations as well.
