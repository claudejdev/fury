A quiet Sunday morning in New York Harbour, itâ€™s cold and windy and the
main topic of conversation at the Sandy Hook New Jersey, Coast Guard
Station is the ongoing fiasco at the Olympics.

This scenario is playable by both sides. It is much more challenging
from the US side and will also provide interesting threads to future
scenarios, playing from the Soviet side is good fun but fairly easy:

As the Soviet player your mission is to disrupt maritime traffic in the
New York Harbour area.

As the US player you are going about your business conducting routine
Coast Guard patrols. The situation will develop.

**<u>Northern Fury \#3</u>** rapidly becomes a frenetic rescue operation
for the US Coast Guard player. This scenario really shows some of the
different methods the Soviets will use to distract NATO and particularly
the US from the main effort in Europe. The American public will
certainly be putting pressure on their government for continental
defence after this scenario.
