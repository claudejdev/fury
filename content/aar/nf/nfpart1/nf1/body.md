You are the commander all forces in Northern Norway. Allied Forces North
Norway (AFNN) HQ is in Bodo Norway, this is a 'dual hat' organization
which maintains National Command of Norwegian forces North of Orland and
reports to Allied Forces North (AFNORTH).

Over the past 6 hours you have deployed 2nd Battalion of Brigade Nord
forward to garrison Banak and recalled the Home Guard to garrison
Kirkenes and other airports in Finmark province in order to facilitate a
limited evacuation of the civilian population. Naval and Air forces have
also staged forward and have gone to a high readiness posture.

The NATO AWACS flight normally allocated to AFNN has been deployed for
the past two weeks in preparation for the Olympics and is ready to
support operations in all respects.

It is a cold day off the North Cape, it is unlikely to stay that way!

**<u>Northern Fury \#1</u>** showcases the start of hostilities in North
Norway. The battle will be intense and at times overwhelming as the
Soviets put into play their plans to knock Norway out of the war. The
old saying of ‘never fight a fair fight if you can avoid it’ applies to
the attacking forces here – NATO is at a distinct disadvantage.
