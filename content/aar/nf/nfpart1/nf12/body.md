The situation in the North Atlantic remains desperate. The rapid capture
of North Norway and Iceland have allowed the Soviets to surge almost 100
submarines into the Atlantic. The USS Enterprise CVBG spent two
difficult days blunting an attempt by the Red Banner Northern Fleet to
interdict the sea lanes, she is now preparing to retire for re-supply
and re-organization, as are the major Soviet surface units. The USS Carl
Vinson CVBG is moving up to relieve the Enterprise while the USS
Eisenhower moves to join the USS Carl Vinson to strike at Soviet forces
around Iceland in three days.

Meanwhile Commander of 2<sup>nd</sup> Fleet is on board the command ship
USS Mount Whitney near the Azores, and the Soviets know it.

This scenario is playable by either WP or NATO:

As the NATO player you must maneuver and protect the USS Mount Whitney
as it transports the Commander of the US 2<sup>nd</sup> Fleet (NATO’s
CINCLANT) to a patrol area off the Azores.

As the WP player you have multiple submarines and valuable intelligence
indicating that a ‘High Value Target’ is arriving in your patrol area.

**<u>Northern Fury \#12</u>** is a much smaller battle featuring /assets
and a situation that will give the player some difficult choices. The
Soviets are certainly up to no-good in the area.
