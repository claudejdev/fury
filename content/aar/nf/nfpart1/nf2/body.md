X-Ray Station was a long-standing patrol area for NATO submarines whose
job it was to keep tabs on the Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet, in
particular the major surface units and the SSBNs.  Several US and
occasionally UK submarines were on this station for almost **30 years!**

This scenario is playable by either side, as NATO your mission is to
'detect and survive' as WP your mission is to 'transit and kill'.

This scenario features the USS Connecticut, SSN 22. Although in actual
history the Connecticut was commissioned in December 98; the alternate
reality of Northern Fury has the Seawolf program proceeding as
originally planned with SSN 21 laid down in 89 and ***<u>29</u>***
submarines of this class commissioned in the next 10 years. I assume
that building would start slowly and only have 4 featured in the
campaign, SSN 21 Seawolf, which you will encounter in the North
Atlantic, SSN 22 in this and future scenarios, SSN 23 Jimmy Carter in
the Pacific and SSN 24 Virginia in the process of commissioning in the
Pacific. The current Virginia class was created as a replacement for the
Seawolf and does not exist in Northern Fury.

**<u>Northern Fury \#2</u>** as the NATO player is quite difficult. You
have submarines only and the Soviets know you are there – they don’t
know where you are, but they are looking very hard. The Soviets face the
challenge of finding some very elusive targets before key units are
detected. The ‘cat’ in this game of ‘can & mouse’ is a sabre-toothed
tiger, and the mouse fights back.
