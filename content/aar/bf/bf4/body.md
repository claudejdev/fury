You are the commander the [Soviet 15<sup>th</sup> Air
Army](http://northernfury.us/warsaw/su/air/vvs/)**. Your formation has
deployed forward into advanced bases in Poland and has been resting for
the past three days. With reinforcements you are tasked to conduct
offensive strikes into Denmark in order to gain air and sea superiority
over Jutland. You are to strike and 25+ runways 20+ naval piers and
several communications bunkers. By completing this operation
successfully, you will enable major follow-on operations to take place
over the next few days. It would be unwise to consider failure.**

**<span class="underline">Baltic Fury \#4</span>** is a challenging
scenario as the list of tasks is long, resources are short and somewhat
limited and you must complete the entire operation in 16 hours. Although
you control between 375 and 400 aircraft, they are of different
capabilities and with some variance in pilot quality.

NATO will be throwing everything they can into the air to stop you.
Although casualties have been high on both sides, western pilots are
generally better trained and ready to meet the larger numbers the
Soviets can attack with.
