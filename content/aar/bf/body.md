**Baltic Fury**

Baltic Fury is a small Battleset comprising five CMO scenarios. Focusing
largely on the struggle between the Soviet [Baltic
Fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Fleet) and NATO’s Allied
Forces Baltic Approaches
([BALTAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_Forces_Baltic_Approaches))
for control of the small and shallow Baltic sea.

The geopolitical situation for the Soviets is much worse here than
during most of the Cold War. With the reunification of Germany and the
troubles in Poland, these allied forces and more importantly the bases
located there either don’t exist or cannot be counted upon.

On the NATO side the bulk of the forces available to BATLAP, at least
initially are Danish and German, two of the countries hardest hit by the
supposed post Cold War *Peace Dividend*. Although reinforcements will
arrive quickly from the UK and in a few days from the US, events
elsewhere will keep the flow of forces into this area small.

Of the five scenarios, three are played from the Soviet side and two
from the NATO side.

3.  Warsaw Uprising, NATO takes advantage of political tensions in the
    region

4.  Ride of the Valkyries, A Soviet bomber division works to destroy
    Denmark’s air defences

5.  Cut to the Jugular, A major Soviet assault on Denmark
