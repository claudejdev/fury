**Baltic Fury \#1 Storm the Gates**

**<span class="underline">You are the commander NATOâ€™s</span>
[BALTAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_Forces_Baltic_Approaches)
<span class="underline">(Baltic Approaches) Command</span>**. BALTAP is
a joint force of land, sea and air forces arrayed specifically to keep
hostile WP forces bottled up in the Baltic Sea. Your forces are
primarily Danish and German but some NATO reinforcements can be
expected. The restricted waters in the western Baltic funnel hostile
forces directly to the island of Zeeland and Copenhagen itself. One
thing is certain, there will be a lot of combat power deployed into a
very small space.

Precautions over the past few hours have put a flight of F-16s forward
on Bornholm Island, a few ships to sea and a NATO AWACs forward in the
area of Kiel Germany. Other forces are preparing but so far there have
been no hostilities.
