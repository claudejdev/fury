**You are the commander NATOâ€™s
[BALTAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_Forces_Baltic_Approaches)
(Baltic Approaches) Command**. BALTAP is a joint force of land, sea and
air forces arrayed specifically to keep hostile WP forces bottled up in
the Baltic Sea. Your forces are primarily Danish and German but some
NATO reinforcements can be expected. The restricted waters in the
western Baltic funnel hostile forces directly to the island of Zeeland
and Copenhagen itself. One thing is certain, there will be a lot of
combat power deployed into a very small space.

Precautions over the past few hours have put a flight of F-16s forward
on Bornholm Island, a few ships to sea and a NATO AWACs forward in the
area of Kiel Germany. Other forces are preparing but so far there have
been no hostilities.

**<span class="underline">Baltic Fury \#1</span>** is an intense
scenario where the Soviets unleash an overwhelming onslaught to try and
overwhelm NATO defences in the first few hours of the war. Early in the
scenario the player is scrambling to muster resources and launch key
counterstrokes when appropriate. As the game progresses and the Soviets
have largely shot their bolt, NATOs position improves somewhat. If you
can weather the storm.
