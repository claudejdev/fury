You are the commander NATOâ€™s
[BALTAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_Forces_Baltic_Approaches)
(Baltic Approaches) Command. BALTAP is a joint force of land, sea and
air forces arrayed specifically to keep hostile WP forces bottled up in
the Baltic Sea. Your forces are primarily Danish and German but some
NATO reinforcements can be expected. The restricted waters in the
western Baltic funnel hostile forces directly to the island of Zeeland
and Copenhagen itself. One thing is certain, there will be a lot of
combat power deployed into a very small space.

Precautions over the past few hours have put a flight of F-16s forward
on Bornholm Island, a few ships to sea and a NATO AWACs forward in the
area of Kiel Germany. Other forces are preparing but so far there have
been no hostilities.

**<u>Baltic Fury \#1</u>** is an intense scenario where the Soviets
unleash an overwhelming onslaught to try and overwhelm NATO defences in
the first few hours of the war. Early in the scenario the player is
scrambling to muster resources and launch key counterstrokes when
appropriate. As the game progresses and the Soviets have largely shot
their bolt, NATOs position improves somewhat. If you can weather the
storm.
