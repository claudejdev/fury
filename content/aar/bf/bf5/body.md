38th Airborne Corps has shifted forward from Carpathian Military
District to command the operation. With a Kaliningrad based MRD as the
key ingredient, two Airborne Divisions and four Brigades (including the
Polish 6th AB Division) and Corps troops - this is a big force. You have
enough air lift to move about 1.5 Divisions at a time with a bunch of
car ferries, RoRos and freighters augmenting the Baltic Fleet's slightly
reduced amphibious force..
