Youâ€™re commanding the **USS *Nimitz* CVBG** and have been tasked to
steam at maximum possible speed north to join 6<sup>th</sup> Fleet in
the Mediterranean. Things are interesting in the Indian Ocean but
positively frantic in the Med.

In this scenario you will need to assemble your Battle Group, neutralize
several layers of enemy defences, proceed through restricted, hazard
laden waters to enter the Red Sea on your journey to the main theater of
operations.

**<span class="underline">Indian Ocean Fury \#3</span>** demonstrates
the hazards that restricted waters present to large warships as the USS
*Nimitz* and her escorts first strike at the Soviet base on Socotra then
transit through the very narrow channel of the Bab al-Mandab. French
forces at Djibouti prove critical, as do some key /assets that are only
available briefly.
