Youâ€™re commanding the USS *Nimitz* CVBG and have been tasked to steam at
maximum possible speed north to join 6<sup>th</sup> Fleet in the
Mediterranean. Things are interesting in the Indian Ocean but positively
frantic in the Med.

In this scenario you will need to assemble your Battle Group, neutralize
several layers of enemy defences, proceed through restricted, hazard
laden waters to enter the Red Sea on your journey to the main theater of
operations.

**<u>Indian Ocean Fury \#3</u>** demonstrates the hazards that
restricted waters present to large warships as the USS *Nimitz* and her
escorts first strike at the Soviet base on Socotra then transit through
the very narrow channel of the Bab al-Mandab. French forces at Djibouti
prove critical, as do some key /assets that are only available briefly.
