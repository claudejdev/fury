You’re commanding the HMS Ark Royal Battle Group which has just
completed a long scheduled port visit to Cape Town South Africa.
Predominantly this was a diplomatic mission to welcome the
post-Apartheid nation back into the fold of the western world, but it
was a good break from patrolling in the Gulf of Aden. Your force is not
ready for operations at the moment, in fact only three of the six ships
under your command are currently in company.

As you travel up the Mozambique Channel between Africa and Madagascar,
you begin to receive disturbing news from Europe and North America.
After conferring with your staff and the Captain of the Ark Royal, you
direct them to make contingency plans should you be directed to cut your
tour with CTF-150 (Combined Task Force 150 – the international force
protecting shipping in the Gulf of Aden and African coast) short and
head to either the Persian Gulf or the Mediterranean. At least things
should be quiet for the next few days of passage north.

**<u>Indian Ocean Fury \#2</u>** follows the path of the Ark Royal and
other forces along the east coast of Africa as the area crawls into
World War Three. Soviet proxy states pop up unexpectedly while the hunt
is on for some elusive surface units hiding in this remote and isolated
area.
