You’re commanding the newly formed CTF 154 centered on the USS
*Saratoga* CVBG and combining all forces in the Persian Gulf region.
Your primary task is to open the Straits of Hormuz to unrestricted
navigation, but a critical and essential secondary task is to tie down
Soviet and Soviet aligned forces (primarily Iran) so they cannot
interfere in other theatres, particularly Syria and the Mediterranean.
Finally, you must impress Saudi Arabia to commit to the conflict on our
side, while preventing the spread of the war.

The Indian Ocean is a secondary theater and you cannot expect many
reinforcements. Commander 5<sup>th</sup> Fleet will deploy to Socotra
Island once it is clear, from there he will fight the larger battles in
the Pentagon, but right now more forces and supplies are leaving the
area then are arriving.

**<u>Indian Ocean Fury \#5</u>** if the player did not understand that
the Indian Ocean was now a secondary theater of operations, this
scenario will demonstrate that point clearly. With a depleted and
limited escort, the *Saratoga* must gather newly assigned forces
arriving from as far afield as Australia and Singapore before making a
strong push against the defences in the Straits of Hormuz.

Of course, the Iranians and their Soviet friends have other ideas in
mind. Mines, air defences and small boat swarms are only the start.
