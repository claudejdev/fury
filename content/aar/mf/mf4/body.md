You are commanding 6<sup>th</sup> Fleet, a powerful but diverse force
currently gathering in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. With the
assistance of the USAF’s 366<sup>th</sup> Expeditionary Air Wing in
Egypt, more Turkish forces, Jordanians and another two F-16 Squadrons,
you need to start the process of dismantling Syria’s ability to
interfere with future operations

A small Soviet naval task group centered on the helicopter carrier
*Moskva* is leading a potent group of escorts and must also be destroyed
