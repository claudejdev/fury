In the second day of the war, Libya remains neutral. Nobody is sure if
that situation will last but the Soviet helicopter carrier *Leningrad*,
along with escorts are anchored off Tripoli, and this is a major threat.

Your mission is to sink the Soviet Ship *Leningrad* and escorts,
hopefully without causing war with Libya. Although this is a delicate
task, you have significant force at your disposal, unfortunately these
are very dispersed and if Libya enters the war unexpectedly, the balance
of power will equalize quickly.

**<span class="underline">Mediterranean Fury \#3</span>** is a difficult
scenario. NATO has significant force but geographically they are
dispersed from Gibraltar to Crete. The Soviets, and their allies in
Libya and Algeria hold a thin but important edge based mostly on
location and concentration of force.
