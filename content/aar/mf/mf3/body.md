In the second day of the war, Libya remains neutral. Nobody is sure if
that situation will last but the Soviet helicopter carrier *Leningrad*,
along with escorts are anchored off Tripoli, and this is a major threat.

Your mission is to sink the Soviet Ship *Leningrad* and escorts,
hopefully without causing war with Libya. Although this is a delicate
task, you have significant force at your disposal, unfortunately these
are very dispersed and if Libya enters the war unexpectedly, the balance
of power will equalize quickly.

**<u>Mediterranean Fury \#3</u>** is a difficult scenario. NATO has
significant force but geographically they are dispersed from Gibraltar
to Crete. The Soviets, and their allies in Libya and Algeria hold a thin
but important edge based mostly on location and concentration of force.
