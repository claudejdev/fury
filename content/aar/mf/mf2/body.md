You are commanding an ESG (Expeditionary Strike Group) centered on the
USS Kearsarge and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). In your 4th
month of patrolling the Mediterranean you were about to commence an
amphibious exercise with the USS Iowa using primarily British forces as
the opposition. That all changed about an hour ago when you received the
DEFCON 4 message from Washington, and an accompanying NATO Alert state
RED.

**<span class="underline">Mediterranean Fury \#2</span>** puts the
player in the position of rapidly transitioning from a peacetime
exercise to a wartime defensive. Syria, with Soviet assistance strikes
hard and fast. The first few hours are tense but as NATO musters its
plentiful resources and gets organized, the player has a chance to seize
the initiative.
