**<u>Pacific Fury \#3 – Caught Flat Footed</u>**

**<u>Playtest Report by Ilya78 May 2021</u>**

OK, here it is… I played with the 1.1 version.

SITUATION

The USS Constellation CVBG was ordered back from Australia to the north
of the Philippines, in order to reinforce the USS Independence CVBG near
Japan. But first, they had to meet a replenishment group NW of Luzon,
and the air wing had to carry out an exercise with aircrafts of the US
and Filipino Air Forces. The replenishment group had already been
departed from Manila.

**FRIENDLY FORCES**

US Navy:

USS Constellation CVBG: USS Constellation (Kitty Hawk CVN); Gridley
(Leahy CG); Ingersoll (Spruance DD); Lake Erie and Vincennes (Tico CGs,
the latter one is catching up from Guam); Mahon S. Tisdale (OHP FFG,
investigating a wrecked trawler (looks like a trap)).

Replenishment group: USS Kinkaid (Spruance DD(VLS)); Willamette
(Cimmaron AO); San José (Mars AFS).

Half of the carrier’s air wing was at Cubi Point, Luzon for an exercise.
The fuel had got contaminated, so most of the aircrafts could not take
off for some hours (probably a sabotage).

USS San Francisco and USS City of Corpus Christi (Los Angeles class SSNs
following the CVBG).

P-3 Orion MPAs in ASW or MS configurations at Cubi Point and Anderson AB
(Guam). EP-3 Aries ELINT at Cubi Point.

US Air Force:

F-5E Tiger II: aggressors for the exercise at Cubi Point

2 KC-135 tankers, a C-141 Starlifter at Cubi Point.

2 B-52s at Anderson AB, being armed with Harpoons (Yess!!!)

Filipino Air Force:

F-5A Freedom Fighters (without radars) at airports on Luzon and Leyte

Interesting attack aircrafts: OV-10A Broncos, AS.211 trainers armed for
ground attack, piston engine (!) SF.260Ws

Recon: F.27 and BN-2 MPAs; Super King Air 200T area surveillance
aircrafts

Filipino Navy:

Miguel Malvar (a relic from World War II); Antonio Luna (a more modern
patrol boat)

**POSSIBLE ENEMY FORCES**

Minsk (Kiev CVH); Frunze (Kirov BCGN); Chervona Ukraina (Slava CG);
Sovremenny and Udaloy DDGs; unknown number of submarines (Juliet,
Victor-II and “something more modern”); aircrafts of the CVH (Yak-141
Freestyles and Yak-38 Forgers); ASW and AEW helicopters of the CVH and
destroyers.

**PLAYTHROUGH**

**EVENING**

Silence before the storm

The ordinary patrols (CAP, ASW, AEW, ELINT) were set up around the CVBG.
The AEW immediately detected an AGI and a destroyer in front of and
behind the fleet, and a Bear MPA was following us as well. The S3 Viking
doing the “carrier far ASW” detected a submarine with its radar (!). I
thought it was the Juliet, so the Viking flew closer and dropped some
sonobuoys. I was right, it was the Juliet at periscope depth, and before
I could do anything, the Viking launched a torpedo and sank the
submarine (which was marked as unfriendly, so practically I started the
hostilities, but nobody saw it). Similar patrols were set up west of
Luzon with the available aircrafts, except for the AEW, because the
Hawkeye was still waiting for fuel. I was afraid of a bomber attack form
Camh Ran AB. A P-3 MS from Guam spotted the “Pelicano”, a large trawler
to the west of the wrecked boat. By some reason, this trawler was
hostile. The Miguel Malvar accelerated to flank speed (15 kts) to reach
the wreck before morning. And at this moment the hell broke loose.

To be continued…

**NIGHT**

Guerilla attacks on Luzon

There were a lot of small boats floating in the bay near Cubi Point AB.
Three of them suddenly turned hostile, and the closest one started
shooting the AB with guns and rockets. And something (probably a pack of
mortars) started shelling the AB from the top of a nearby hill. I
changed the WRA for the Kinkaid and launched three Harpoons on the three
hostile boats. Two of them hit their targets (including the attacking
boat), but the third one missed and sank a civilian boat (they were too
close to each other, sorry...). Both the AB and the Filipino Navy gave
me a patrol boat, and they finished off the last guerilla boat. AS.211
trainers and OV-10 Broncos took off to silence the mortars. The trainers
could not hit anything, but the Broncos made short work of them. This
attack costed me 6(!) F/A-18D Hornets, 3 Tomcats, both tankers and an
ES-3 Shadow. And this was the smaller problem...

Doom of the Gridley

Right when the attacks on Luzon started, the carrier AEW detected a huge
number of low and high flying missiles launced from the north and flying
towards the carrier group (low flying, SS-N-19 Shipwrecks) and the USS
Vincennes (high flying, SS-N-12 Sandboxes). So both the Kirov BCGN and
the Slava CG launched their missiles at the same time. And suddenly
another 24 Shipwrecks and 16 Sandboxes appeared on the radar. What is
happening here? Probably there was an Oscar class SSGN in the area (in
addition to the Kirov), and the Soviet destroyers launched their
missiles, too. All available fighters took off from the carrier and
tried to shoot down the very fast and very low flying Soviet missiles.
They were qutie ineffective, those missiles shook off the Sidewinders.
SAMs launched from the destroyers and cruisers shot down one missile
after another. The Vincennes heroically defended herself fron two salvos
of Sandboxes, but she had only 10 SAMs left at the end. However, the
carrier group had a bad luck. One missile somehow got through the SAMs
(the CIWS were completely ineffective against it) and impacted into the
USS Gridley, which exploded to pieces. The crew of the carrier saw the
gigantic explosion, which cannot be survived by anyone. The Soviets had
to pay for it.
