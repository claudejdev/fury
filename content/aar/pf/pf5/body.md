You are Commander of [143<sup>rd</sup> Red Banner Missile Aviation
Division](http://www.ww2.dk/new/navy/143mrad.htm) based at Mongokhoto
Airbase, part of the Soviet Pacific Fleet. In response to an American
attack on the Crimea a couple days ago, you have been tasked to attack
an American base in the Near Islands, part of what the US calls the
Aleutian Islands chain.

Of course, there are a few complications; the Americans have deployed a
squadron of F-15s there as part of their NORAD defence, you have the
unreliable support of a PVO squadron of MiG-31s, and you must be very
careful not to damage their COBRA DANE radar or they will think we are
starting a nuclear war.

**<u>Pacific Fury \#5</u>** as the Soviet player once again, the
friction between branches of the military remains a concern, but so do
the Americans. Shemya is the closest American base to Soviet soil and
this operation is meant to send a message to Washington. The player’s
task is to send the correct message – damaging the COBRA DANE will most
certainly send the unintended message that you are preparing for nuclear
war – this must be avoided. Unfortunately to remain safe, the bombers
must stay above the range of ground based air defences, which means that
many of their 1950’s era bombs may miss their intended target by several
hundred meters, and it is a very small island.
