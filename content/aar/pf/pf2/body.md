You are the Deputy Commander of the Soviet High Command of the Far East
(GKVDV). You have been given the task of neutralizing Japanese and
American forces on the island of Hokkaido to ensure safe passage of
naval and air forces into the Pacific. While your commander is dealing
with Moscow you have been given this critical but secondary task. It
wonâ€™t be easy, especially when many of your assigned forces have a
separate chain of command and/or have different objectives.

**<u>Pacific Fury \#2</u>** is an interesting scenario played from the
Soviet side. Although the Japanese and American defenders on Hokkaido
have the technological edge over the players air forces, the Soviets
have numbers on their side. However, one of the key complications to be
negotiated is the divergent chains of command and different objective of
each force contributor.

The main objective is to close the massive fighter base outside Sapporo,
Chitose airbase, home to Japanese F-15 and supported by American F-16s
from Misawa to the south. Secondary objectives include the air defence
network, Electronic Warfare and Communications facilities and ensuring
that the La Pirouse Strait is open for the navy to use.
