You are the commander of the USS *Independence* Carrier Battle Group.
Your carrier and its battle group are the US Navies ‘Forward Deployed’
force based in Yokosuka Japan as part of the US 7<sup>th</sup> Fleet. In
a normal year, your force would spend the winter months in port
refitting, but this is not a normal year. Instead, the battle group
deployed to the Philippians in early January for a multi-carrier
exercise with USS *Constellation* and USS *Abraham Lincoln*, then a
Freedom of Navigation run through the Strait of Taiwan, and finally an
amphibious exercise with the South Koreans.

Now, plans to head home were canceled last night and we’ve been ordered
to deploy to the south coast of Hokkaido for a deterrence operation. The
Japanese government has been getting extremely nervous over the past few
weeks and the fiasco at the Olympics has spooked them. We are planning
to do a restricted passage drill through the Tsugaru Strait and spend
about 72 hours patrolling up as far as the southern Kurils. The
35<sup>th</sup> Fighter Wing at Misawa has promised us a squadron of
F-16s to run some air defence drills for us as well.

Should be a quiet week. What could possibly go wrong?

**<u>Pacific Fury \#1</u>** is an and intense scenario. As the player
moves his forces up the west coast of Japan, the Soviets spring a well
orchestrated ambush which will be very difficult to contend with.

Other events will also keep the player busy but surviving the first few
hours of the war will be paramount.
