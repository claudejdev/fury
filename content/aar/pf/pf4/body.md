**You are Commander of the newly formed Combined Task Force 165
(CTF-165). Your TF consists of mostly Australian and New Zealand /assets
but there are also American, Pilipino, Bruneian and British forces
assigned to you. Your primary task is the reinforcement of Brunei, a
small British aligned Sultanate rich in oil and natural gas on the
Northwest coast of Borneo.**

**The main opposition is from the Soviet base at Cam Ranh Bay Vietnam
but based on events of the past few days you should be prepared for
anything.**

**<span class="underline">Pacific Fury \#4</span>** places the player in
the awkward position of having to steam at high speed into the unknown
while navigating restricted waters, difficult political challenges and
an elusive enemy.

The players forces, land sea and air â€“ are spread from west of Singapore
to east of Darwin and they all need to converge on Brunei. The Soviets
at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam are a problem but so are insurgents in Bruni
and elsewhere and the ever-present danger of submarines.
