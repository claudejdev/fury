You are Commander of the newly formed Combined Task Force 165 (CTF-165).
Your TF consists of mostly Australian and New Zealand /assets but there
are also American, Pilipino, Bruneian and British forces assigned to
you. Your primary task is the reinforcement of Brunei, a small British
aligned Sultanate rich in oil and natural gas on the Northwest coast of
Borneo.

The main opposition is from the Soviet base at Cam Ranh Bay Vietnam but
based on events of the past few days you should be prepared for
anything.

**<u>Pacific Fury \#4</u>** places the player in the awkward position of
having to steam at high speed into the unknown while navigating
restricted waters, difficult political challenges and an elusive enemy.

The players forces, land sea and air â€“ are spread from west of Singapore
to east of Darwin and they all need to converge on Brunei. The Soviets
at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam are a problem but so are insurgents in Bruni
and elsewhere and the ever-present danger of submarines.
