**Caribbean Fury**

Caribbean Fury is a small Battleset comprising five CMO scenarios.
Focusing largely on the struggle between the US and some small NATO
elements against Soviet sponsored uprisings, terrorism and outright
warfighting from several Central American and Caribbean countries.

Although this region is America’s back yard, the commitment of forces
here equates it to a backwater. In the early hours of the conflict there
can be overwhelming American force available, but most of it is tagged
to deploy around the globe leaving second and third string elements to
deal with the mess the Soviets have made. NATO allies are also present
but they are short on resources and long on demands, some of which the
Americans don’t agree with.

To the Soviets, the Caribbean is a sideshow, a distraction where its
proxies can tie down American forces at little or no cost to the main
effort in Europe. Beyond a few squadrons of modern aircraft and some air
defence systems provided to Cuba, most of the effort is behind the
scenes. Venezuela however, is a wild card and has not accepted the
Soviets plan to the degree Moscow wanted. Caracas will still be a
problem that Washington will need to deal with though.
