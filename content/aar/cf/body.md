**Caribbean Fury**

Caribbean Fury is a small Battleset comprising five
[CMO](https://command.matrixgames.com/?m=202105) scenarios. Focusing
largely on the struggle between the United States and Soviet supported
states such as Cuba, Honduras, Nicaragua and Venezuela as well as proxy
groups such as Guatemalan rebels in Belize and Panamanian freedom
fighters. Although some NATO and Caribbean countries play a supporting
role, their forces are small and their political and geographic baggage
cause significant problems. Many details are located at this

From a Soviet standpoint, the Caribbean is a side-show. The main purpose
is to distract the United States and tie down resources. Of course, the
ideological rhetoric will be loud and the drive for ‘peoples parties’
will be high, Moscow is willing to sacrifice their distant allies and
hand-me-down hardware to achieve its European goals.

The United States however cannot be so callus in its own back yard. Cuba
has been a thorn in America’s side for the past thirty-five years, and
of course the festering cocaine and cartel induced friction with
Honduras and Nicaragua has been problematic on many levels. The US
government cannot afford a loss in this region, and the US military
cannot afford to commit too many ships, aircraft or soldiers here and
still hope to stave off the Soviet attacks elsewhere.

The situation is ripe for a desperate struggle with limited /assets.
