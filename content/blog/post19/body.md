On the 19<sup>th</sup> of August 1991, hard-liners in the Soviet
leadership, calling themselves the 'State Emergency Committee', launched
the ‘August Coup’ in order to remove Gorbachev from power and prevent
the signing of the new union treaty. Although experiencing some initial
setbacks and resounding world condemnation – the coup was a success. The
concepts of Perestroika and Glasnost, and the economic and political
restructuring they implied, were abolished overnight. Independence
movements in 14 states were ruthlessly quashed, including those in
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Georgia where self-rule had already been
declared. Internal strife reminiscent of the 1920’s lasted for just
several months but the iron rule of the reinvigorated Communist Party
prevailed in all areas.

NATO watched nervously as their efforts to encourage Eastern European
countries away from Dictatorship were methodically dashed. Only Poland
and the re-unified Germany managed to avoid the restoration of the
Warsaw Pact. Poland has declared itself Neutral and Non-aligned; however
significant pro Eastern Bloc movements exist and are in a constant
struggle with its emerging Capitalist economy. Germany is in a difficult
position as many of its Left Wing political elements have been proposing
the abandonment of collective defense as a viable strategy for the
future.

Meanwhile, NATO was decisively engaged as its (original 16) various
governments were attempting to realize the ‘peace dividend’ by reducing
military forces, and employing what is left in non-traditional roles in
order to justify costs. With significantly reduced Land, Sea and Air
forces embroiled in the Balkans, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Rwanda and
The Sudan. Resources are spread thinner than they have been since the
1940’s. Tensions with Iraq are high and the threat to stability in the
Middle East is extreme.

On the 9<sup>th</sup> of February 1994, a Soviet supported Coup toppled
the Polish government and sent the emergent democratic state into
anarchy. The UN Security council response was futile and an emergency
sitting of NATO’s North Atlantic Council (NAC) was called for the
12<sup>th</sup> of February.

In Norway - The International Olympic Committee (IOC), in consultation
with the UN decided to carry on with the Winter Games which were opened
in Lillehammer, on February 12th. Soviet and Eastern Bloc countries were
represented at the opening ceremonies but many of their athletes were
not present for the start of the actual events on the 13<sup>th</sup>.
The Russian Olympic village was empty and initial investigation found
that many of the athletes had simply disappeared, while only a few had
flown home. Norway has called up its reserves and ordered the IOC to
cancel the games and evacuate the Olympic Village. The world is in an
uproar over the loss of the Olympic spectacle and TV commentators all
over the Globe are criticizing Norway’s decision.

**Designer’s Notes**:

This is a Classic Third World War setting which focuses on the breakout
of the Red Banner Northern Fleet and its operations in the North
Atlantic. Many Soviet platforms historically decommissioned between 1989
and 1994 remain active.

In response to the ‘91 Coup, the US military has had some success with
Congress in obtaining needed funding. The *USS Ranger (CV-61)* was not
decommissioned but instead, held in San Diego with reduced crew and no
air group as ready reserve. The *USS Forrestal (CV-59)* was retained as
an air training carrier. *USS Enterprise (CVN-65)* completed an
accelerated overhaul 8 months early and is deployed to Puerto Rico on
her sea trials at the end of Jan 94. All other CV/CVN refits were put on
hold or hastily completed which necessitated the retention of Carrier
Air Wing (CAW) 10 on the *USS John F. Kennedy (CV 67)* and authorization
of a 13<sup>th</sup> CAW. CAW 6 formed initially from USMC and reserves,
is now fully established from regular USN squadrons, causing the
retention in service of some additional A6-Es, (which had been on a fast
track to decommissioning in order to man F/A-18 Squadrons) and is now on
*Enterprise*. *USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70)* remained in the Atlantic to
fill a scheduling gap in 91/92 but the *USS George Washington (CVN 73)*
has now deployed to fill the gap in the Pacific (a reversal of historic
real world deployments). *USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74)* is nearing
completion and will begin its workups in June 94, once she is deployed
*CV 61 Ranger* will de-commission and *CV 60 Saratoga* will take up the
reserve role in San Diego.

All of the *Iowa* class BBs were retained in service. Many other ships
historically decommissioned due to the ‘piece dividend’ were retained;
in particular, the CGNs the *Belknap* and *Leahy* CGs and some older
DDG/FF/FFGs; some construction and refits were accelerated. Some details
here:

  - The *USS Ranger (CV-61)* was not decommissioned but instead, held in
    San Diego with reduced crew and no air group as ready reserve. But
    will be retired when *USS John C. Stennis (CGN-74)* is commissioned.

  - The *USS Forrestal (CV-59)* was retained as an air training carrier.

  - *USS Enterprise (CVN-65)* completed an accelerated overhaul 8 months
    early

  - All of the *Iowa* class BBs were retained in service

  - All CGNs were retained.  Total 9: 4 x *Virginia*, 2 x *California*,
    *Long Beach*, *Bainbridge* & *Truxton*.

![](/assets/images/blog/post19/image6.jpeg)

  - All *Belknap* & *Leahy* CGs were retained (9 of each) with the NTU
    (New Threat Upgrades) complete. The additional 27 CG/CGNs means that
    a third CG/CGN can deploy with most CVBGs as well as act as Flag for
    smaller TGs.

  - 4 of 29 *Seawolf* Class SSNs have been completed with 3-5
    commissioning per year.  The *Virginia* Class has not been designed
    or considered.

![](/assets/images/blog/post19/image7.jpeg)

  - 28 *Sturgeon* Class plus the 9 long hull (*Archerfish*) Class, the
    *Narwhal* and 3x *Permit* class SSNs were retained. The *Permit’s*
    followed by the *Sturgeons* will decommission as the *Seawolf’s*
    come on line once the fleet stabilizes at 100 fleet boats and 12
    special mission boats

  - 7 *Arleigh Burke’s* have been completed with 5-6 per year planned to
    the planned 62 units.

  - Because of the urgent need for ASW escorts, the shortage of dry-dock
    space and the increased number of TLAM carrying ships; the last 7 of
    31 *Spruance* class DDGs will not be upgraded to carry the Vertical
    Launch System but will remain ASW DDs and undergo shorter mid-life
    refits than the other 24 ships. The 4 *Kidd* Class DDGs received
    their NTU in the late 80’s and will serve another 20 years.

  - The *Farragut* Class DDGs have been retained, 6x NTU refits have
    been completed, all based on the East Coast, the remaining 4
    completing later this year

  - Only 3 *Charles F. Adams* NTU DDGs are ready but another 12 are
    undergoing refit and will complete in the next 18 months. Both of
    the older DDG classes will serve until \~2000 when enough of the
    *Arleigh Burke’s* are available

  - The 51 unit *Oliver Hazard Perry* Class had completed commissioning
    in 89 with no replacement on the horizon. The Navy pointed out this
    gap to Congress and a further 12 were ordered in 91 with the first 4
    already launched and due to commission later in 94. As a stop-gap 4
    *Brooke* Class FFG’s (FFG-3-6) were retained but will be
    decommissioned later this year. A ‘Follow on Frigate’ program is
    underway with a bid for 72 units, the first being laid down in early
    95 and will replace both the OHP and the *Knox* Class in the escort
    role. The OHP will average 30 years of service when decommissioned.

  - 36 of the 46 ship *Knox* class FFs remain in service, the remaining
    10 are mothballed. The problem plagued design will be replaced by
    the ‘Follow on Frigate’ program on a 2 for 1 basis starting in 96
    with most only serving 25-27 years. (Historic real life service was
    only 23 years)

The START II treaty limits were largely adhered to, with the major
exception that 96 B-52Gs and the single B-1 due to retire are retained,
as well as a reduced fleet of F-111 E & F. The first 6 B-2s were rushed
into service and along with 2 of the prototypes have formed the first
Squadron of 8 stealth bombers. The remainder will be produced at a rate
of 6/year and will allow for the gradual retirement of the B-52G’s. SSBN
limits were complied with although 1 x Ohio class SSBN was put in
service 2 months early.

The US Army is in the most difficult position. A Brigade sized force
remains in Soudi Arabia and Kuwait on Operation SOUTHERN WATCH. In
Europe, V Corps remains active in Germany with *1<sup>st</sup> Armd* and
*1<sup>st</sup> Infantry Divisions* supported by *2<sup>nd</sup> Armd
Cavalry Regiment* (ACR). Also, VII Corps which was due to decommission
after the Gulf war was retained but reduced to 1 Brigade for each
Division in Germany and the remainder in the US (*3<sup>rd</sup> Armd,
3<sup>rd</sup>* and *8<sup>th</sup> Infantry Divisions*), *11 ACR*
remains in Germany. The POMCUS sites have been kept fully operational
and 6 Brigades worth of equipment have been added (for VII Corps units).
