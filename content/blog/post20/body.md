**<u>Caribbean Fury Background</u>**:

Note that this is fictional background to the scenarios for Command:
Modern Air & Naval Operations. Events depicted here many not be exactly
the same as in the books.

The short Caribbean series represent events running parallel to the
early days of Northern Fury. The Soviet Foreign Service has been
actively instigating trouble in America’s back yard. U.S. domestic
difficulties and a global ‘Post-Cold War’ malaise made western response
to the evolving issues fragmented, conflicting and generally
ineffective.

In Nicaragua, American withdrawal of all support to the Contra’s after
the Iran-Contra fiasco, allowed the Sandinista’s breathing space;
however, when the anti-Sandinista ‘Chamorro’ government won the election
in 1990 the revolutionary movement immediately restarted ending in a
bloody coup in 92 with a Soviet leaning Sandinista Junta in control. A
major funding proposal involves the planning and eventual building of a
Nicaraguan Canal to compete with Panama, funding, construction and
control of which would be from Moscow.

Although Honduras maintained a marginally effective government with
significant US aid through the 80’s, the cessation of funding and
support of the Contras’ in Nicaragua left a power vacuum which the US
trained army could not effectively fill. By 1989 the Cinchoneros
Liberation movement, now with significant Soviet backing gained the
upper hand and several Army and Air Force units turned to their cause.
The televised execution of 37 American soldiers caused world outrage but
was quickly eclipsed by events in Europe and elsewhere. US retaliatory
cruise missile strikes at rebel targets were followed by a raft of
hostage taking incidents, piracy against civilian shipping and a general
withdraw of the expatriate community. The coup in May of 91 was widely
anticipated but a forgone conclusion with the former President and
family already living at their palatial residence near Portland Oregon.

Following the coups’ in Honduras and Nicaragua, a militaristic
anti-American movement gained momentum and these new governments started
rearming with cast off Algerian and Libyan equipment (as these two
countries rearm themselves, mostly with Polish and former East German
equipment – see Mediterranean Fury) aided by Soviet deception, training,
transport and financial resources.

An attempted coup in Guatemala failed due to US clandestine activities,
but there remains a solid anti-Western sentiment, including significant
numbers of displaced jungle fighters who have now taken on the cause of
freeing Belize of British rule. Costa Rica has remained stable as has
Panama, although attempts in both countries to overthrow western
supporting governments have been made, they failed miserably. The El
Salvadoran Civil war rages on with both the US backed government and the
FNLN precipitating atrocities which get more shocking every year.

Colombia has remained staunchly pro-western, and billions of US dollars
ensure they remain so. The leftist guerrilla movements, primarily FARC
but there are others, that started in the 60’s have gained strength but
are relatively well contained. The drug cartels however have significant
and expanding power, outspending the government on technology and now
using safe havens in Honduras and Nicaragua to ease their transport
risk.

Mexico is showing signs of emerging out of economic and political
distress. It is relying heavily on the newly signed North American Free
Trade Agreement and the population are expecting great things. So is the
world, with the evolving revolt in the Chiapas region causing new
concern! With 12 F-5s and Gearing class destroyers, the US will
undoubtedly be drawn into any conflict. Rebellion is in the wings should
NAFTA fail to improve the Mexican economy.

Venezuela entered a new phase in its history with Hugo Chavez seizing
power during his 2<sup>nd</sup> Coup attempt in 1992 and the death of
President Perez while enroute to his impeachment hearings. Sitting on
vast oil reserves and solidly linking itself to the new Soviet
Government, Venezuela is quickly evolving as a regional power. By
exerting political and financial energy and at times the threat of
military involvement, neighboring countries are falling into line with
Chavez’s vision of a resurgent Caribbean trading block to control
international trade into the Central and South American region. Local
U.S., British, Spanish, Dutch, French and other interests have all been
negatively affected.

US efforts in Haiti and the continuing support of the Dominican Republic
continue along historical lines, as does the evolution of the Eastern
Caribbean islands.

Cuba, as always is the most interesting of the Caribbean countries. With
a resurgence of Soviet interest the Cuban military and air force in
particular has been experiencing a period of revival not seen since the
late 50’s. It is suspected that most of the older SAM systems have been
replaced by newer and much more capable ones, probably SA-10’s, and that
the older MiG 17’s & 21’s have been replaced by MiG-23’s and 29’s. It is
rumoured that a Kilo class submarine is now on the inventory. Two weeks
ago, three RORO ships unloaded under cover of darkness, heavy security
and some obvious deception measures. All of this was monitored by U.S.
security agencies but it is unclear what was unloaded, indications are
that it was not missiles, but probably aircraft, munitions and support
equipment of various types.

**US Reaction**: In response to the increased tension in the region the
US military has stationed about 20 ships including the aircraft carrier
*USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67)* and its Battle Group in the area. The
Carrier is temporarily based at Gulfport Mississippi while many of the
other ships are based in Mayport Florida and Corpus Christy Texas.
Additionally, forces and activities in Panama, Guantanamo Bay and other
areas of the Gulf and Caribbean are at higher than normal levels.
