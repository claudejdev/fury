**Background information for Indian Ocean Fury**

The information that follows is aimed at helping to understand the
Northern Fury world as it pertains to the Indian Ocean region. The area
holds three ‘Hotspots’ that we in the west have come to know quite well
over the past few decades; The Persian Gulf, Somalia and the Somali
coast and Yemen. Another flashpoint, arguably the most important, is
India and Pakistan, but little attention is thrown that way, at least in
North America. Although there’s been a fascination with the area since
the Iranian revolution in 1979, its been since the Gulf War - coinciding
with the end of the Cold War - where the region has been constantly in
focus throughout the west. Interestingly, when designing this series,
it’s often struck me that if a real war, a big war, were to occur - we
wouldn’t be focusing our attention or our militaries here. The Indian
Ocean region would quickly become a backwater as vital forces are pulled
into the major fighting in the north Atlantic and north Pacific areas.

Therefore, the region is fertile ground for developing interesting
situations where resources of all types are at a premium. The Soviet
Union, well aware of the west’s fascination with the Persian Gulf, its
oil and its dictators, will undoubtedly attempt to keep the focus here
and therefore tie down forces that might make the difference elsewhere.
The west, primarily the US, with the UK and France playing a large role,
will be trying to establish a balance; minimizing forces committed here
while ensuring that they maintain freedom of navigation and a reliable
flow of commerce - particularly oil.

Geographically the Indian Ocean is massive, representing 20% of the
world’s ocean surface. While not as large as the Atlantic or Pacific –
it’s remoteness from the East-West interchange of the northern
hemisphere make it difficult to support militarily. Nations, or more
accurately continents bordering on the Indian Ocean, with the notable
exception of Australia, tend to be less developed (in 1994) and much
less ‘modern’. Local militaries are smaller and tend to use older
technology and tactics.

The ‘Northern Fury’ story is consistent with actual history until about
1989, when it begins to diverge. The five years between 1989 and 1994
were very active in this region and that is not very different in our
alternate history. Below is a summary of key events occurring and any
diversions from that reality:

So, based on the above and some other factors the key points that impact
the Indian Ocean region are:

-   Gulf War happened as it did historically, Iraq is neutered and
    unable to exert too much influence. Operation Southern and Northern
    Watch are ongoing with deployment of Coalition forces continuing
    roughly in line with historic deployments.

-   Hard(er) line government in Iran. Evidence of Soviet funding and
    refurbishment of equipment

-   Saudi Arabia is less ‘in bed’ with the west due to continued western
    support of Egypt and other Gulf states, and a desire to keep Soviet
    benevolence as an option

-   Conflict in Somalia, the civil war, UN mission, battle of Mogadishu
    and withdraw of forces happened as they did in reality.

-   Eastern Africa is unsettled; the continued influence of the Soviet
    Union is in direct conflict with China’s attempt to make inroads
    into African politics. Compounded by a general lack of interest in
    the West, this ongoing friction is leaving opportunities for
    exploitation by an aggressive Soviet foreign policy.

-   Apparent sponsorship of piracy is starting to gain momentum. The
    going rates in this history for 1994 is \~ $10/Ton, so a bounty of
    \~2-3 Million USD is not uncommon. The ships are run aground, the
    crews freed and the cargo is sometimes sold as a bonus, or just
    looted locally. CTF 150 is patrolling off of Somalia but so far it’s
    a losing battle.

-   CTF 151 is established in the Gulf of Aden in an effort to curb
    Piracy there, but also out of concern for a deteriorating situation
    in Yemen

-   CTF 149 in the Northern Persian Gulf continues as it historically
    did.

-   NATO establishes a standing Mine Countermeasures group at Djibouti
    to counter the persistent appearance of mines in the Bab-el Mandeb
    (BEM) (SNMCMG 3).

-   The US establishes 5th Fleet HQ in Bahrain in Dec 1993, about 18
    months earlier than it did historically.

-   The French have reinforced their position in Djibouti somewhat.

-   Tensions between India and Pakistan are very high

**Sub-Regions:** The following is a quick roundup of the situation by
nation, running roughly clockwise around the region.

**<u>South East Africa:</u>** Ongoing friction sponsored by both the
USSR and China have caused continued unrest in this area.

**South Africa** is just coming out of the Apartheid era and has
resoundingly elected the ANC in a remarkably free and fair election
(held in Jan vice Apr 94). The new South African Government is torn
between severing ties with its colonial past and bolstering its defences
against regional instability. The long ignored military is suffering
from a significant technology gap.

**Mozambique,** after 15 years of civil war the country will attempt to
hold an election in March 94. The Soviet backed FRELIMO who seized power
after independence from Portugal and held the upper hand for most of the
civil war is expected to win easily. Many factions are already calling
the upcoming elections a hoax and a cover for a Communist backed
dictatorship. A significant amount of Soviet support has been funneled
into the county over the past 3 years.

**Madagascar** has spiraled into authoritarian rule since the President
of the ‘Second Republic’ Vice Admiral Ratsiraka took a hard line after
his bodyguard shot unarmed protesters in 1991. He was able to tighten
his grip on power with financial and military aid provided by Bulgaria,
Romania and the USSR.

**The Comoros**, gained its independence from France in 1975 and has had
a turbulent succession of governance since then (30 Coups or attempts
between 1975 and 2008). There is no military to speak of but the French
Foreign Legion barracks remains on the Island of Mayotte.

**<u>East Central Africa:</u>** Instability fueled by Soviet Foreign
Policy.

**Tanzania,** is a single party socialist republic, attempts by
dissident leaders in 1992 to change to a multi party state were
ruthlessly put down. Ongoing support from the USSR propped up the
corrupt dictatorship which has become quite aggressive towards
neighboring Kenya.

**Uganda**, after the fall of Idi Amin in 1979, the Tanzania sponsored
government was toppled in 1986 and replaced by a short lived progressive
president. In 1990 another coup, probably sponsored by Tanzania gained
power. Since 1990 Uganda has followed Tanzania’s lead in most issues,
including receiving second hand military hardware from Eastern European
countries.

**Kenya**, one of the most stable countries in Africa. Led by President
Moi since 1978 who has won 4 elections, including in 1992, one which
allowed for opposition parties to run for the first time. Kenya is pro
west and still very British in its attitudes toward external policies.
Although the west has to look the other way when domestic issues get
ugly, such as the massacre of thousands of ethnic Somalis.

**<u>Horn of Africa</u>**: You really can’t make this stuff up!

**Somalia**, as a country is in a very bad way. The corruption and
despotism of the 80’s lead to the Civil war which still rages. The
failed US led coalition ‘United Task Force’ (UNTAF) to support delivery
of humanitarian aid collapsed at the end of 1993 and has withdrawn.
Remaining elements of the UN (UNOSOM II) and humanitarian organizations
are in disarray. In Northern Fury, Somalia is even more fragmented than
in the historic world (if that is possible!), Soviet funding has spurred
on piracy and sponsored fractious groups which thrive on instability.
Somali military forces have virtually ceased to exist, weapons, soldiers
and even formed units have found their way into several warring
factions. The government has no control over any effective military
force, particularly air or naval elements which, by 1991 were completely
ineffective anyway.

**Ethiopia**, continues to be supported by the Soviet Union. Attempts at
forming a Democratic Republic faltered early in the process when Soviet
funds started flowing into the economy again. The ‘Derg era’ a Soviet
backed Marxist-Leninist military dictatorship continued. As expected the
Military - large in 91, grew slightly but most importantly, became more
competent as internal strife was extinguished and flair-ups on the
border with Somalia became common.

**Djibouti**, although there is an ongoing, low level civil war (that
won’t be settled until 2000), Djibouti is considered ‘stable’ in this
region. Staunch allies with both its former colonial patriarch France,
and its financial patriarch the US, means it is good business for all
sides to keep a lid on domestic problems. Militarily, the most important
element is basing rights for both France and the US. Proximity to the
Bab-el-Mandeb (BEM) straits makes this a very strategic location and
both France and the US are eager to ensure freedom of navigation through
the Red Sea by keeping the BEM secure. The new NATO SNMCMG 3 has just
set up its base of operations here.

**Eritrea**, gained independence from Ethiopia in 1991 after a 30 year
war of independence (or civil war from Ethiopia’s point of view). In
1993 the UN sponsored a referendum which voted overwhelmingly for
independence. Following this vote the EPLF (Eritrean People’s Liberation
Front) seized power, established a single party socialist government and
firmly gripped all organs of power (They are still in power and there
have been no elections to date -2018). The military is not large but is
staunchly loyal, and is Soviet equipped and trained.

**Sudan**, (not technically part of the Horn of Africa but put here for
convenience) - Now since reality and fiction cross - this is a direct
lift from Wiki:

*On 30 June 1989, Colonel Omar al-Bashir led a bloodless military coup.
The new military government suspended political parties and introduced
an Islamic legal code on the national level. Later al-Bashir carried out
purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of
associations, political parties, and independent newspapers, and the
imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists. On 16 October
1993, al-Bashir appointed himself "President" and disbanded the
Revolutionary Command Council. The executive and legislative powers of
the council were taken by al-Bashir.*

The only thing to add from a Northern Fury perspective - Bashir is on
the Soviet funding list and is keeping his military up to date.

**<u>Arabian Peninsula/Gulf States</u>**: Rich and getting richer.

**Saudi Arabia,** a staunch ally of the US and the west but quite
reluctant to involve itself with Cold War conflict. Ties with the Soviet
Union are not nearly as strong as those with the west but they do exist
and there is a faction within the politically powerful that resent the
west’s and in particularly US interference and demands. The long
standing hatred of Iran is tempered by the west’s support for Saudi
Arabia’s other arch rival - Egypt. With the exception of Yemen,
relations with other neighbors are good - the neighbors have no choice.
Yemen is another situation entirely.

**Yemen,** appeared to be moving along the road to recovery with
unification in 1990 and an elected government, until the Gulf War. When
Yemen opposed non-Arab states from expelling Iraq from Kuwait, voting
against several UN Security Council resolutions, the US was furious -
and Saudi Arabia was livid! Saudi Arabia expelled 800,000 Yemenis,
increasing the population by about 8-9% and precipitating food
shortages, riots and a downward spiral into civil war by late 93
(historically the civil war started in May 94). The Soviet Union found
the situation quite convenient and offered economic and military
assistance.

**Oman,** the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman is one of the more stable
countries in the region. A founding member of Gulf Cooperation Council,
Oman is friendly to the west. Considering itself progressive, women have
been allowed to vote since 1991 and the upcoming election later in 1994
will see female candidates in the general election for the first time -
a first amongst the Arab countries in the Gulf.

**UAE,** very rich and pro west, the United Arab Emirates was also a
founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The UAE supported the
coalition against Iraq in 1991 and is in the process of negotiating
military defence agreements with the US and France.

**Qatar,** another rich and progressive (to a point) nation that is very
friendly with the US and the west. Qatar fought in the coalition against
Iraq and was heavily engaged in the battle of Khafji. Qatar is also a
founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council.

**Bahrain,** is the financial hub of the Arab world, replacing Beirut in
this role during the Lebanese Civil War. Banking combined with oil make
Bahrain’s economy more diverse than other Gulf States, but there is
unrest among Shia fundamentalists evidenced by a failed coup in 1991.
The government is very friendly with the west and provides naval basing
to the US and UK. 5th Fleet HQ is located in Manama.

**Kuwait,** the focus of the 1991 Gulf war when Iraq invaded and the US
led coalition assembled then expelled them. [<u>Kuwait is still
recovering</u>](http://countrystudies.us/persian-gulf-states/33.htm)
from the war, although the 700 oil well fires were extinguished within a
year, the environmental and economic damage was immense. Interestingly
Kuwait's population is now about half of what it was prior to the
invasion, not due to casualties, but because the government is far more
reluctant to allow non-Kuwaitis to enter. Rebuilding the oil industry
and infrastructure has gone relatively quickly, reaching 50% of
pre-invasion levels within 18 months - although there is still much to
do and Billions to spend before it regains its pre-invasion status.

**Iraq,** the post Gulf War Iraq is an economic basket case. The Hussein
government refused to disarm after the war and it is widely rumoured to
maintain significant stocks of chemical weapons which it used, at least
once, against its Kurdish population since the end of the war. The
resultant international sanctions and the no-fly zone imposed by UN
Security Council Resolutions have left the country crippled. The Iraqi
military is in very bad shape with few workable aircraft or ships and
very questionable fighting quality within the army.

**Iran,** the hard line anti-western government in Tehran has become
even more acerbic towards the US and Europe since starting to receive
increased military, economic and technical assistance from the Soviets,
about the time of the start of the Gulf war. Little access is available
in Iran but it’s now clear that the post-Khomeini regime is even more
hard line than before. Although forced to a truce in the Iran-Iraq war,
most in Iran considered it a clear win - that is certainly what they
were told. Very little is known within Iran about the 1991 Gulf War and
the destruction of the Iraqi armed forces, but it is certain that those
in the Iranian government who do know, are ecstatic about the defeat of
their hated enemy, but cautious about the combat capability of their
other hated enemy - the US; locally known as the Great Satan.

**<u>Indian Sub-Continent</u>**: Where hatred festers!

**Pakistan,** needs the economic support of the west, and the west needs
Pakistan to be an ally in an area rife with Soviet influence. The 1990’s
are not shaping up to be a good decade for Pakistan however. With the
death of long-time (for Pakistan) President Zia in 1988, conflicting
left and right wing ideologies started to rip the country apart and
unearthed decades of corruption and internal cultural strife and
oppression. The struggle with India is ever present, the three wars and
constant skirmishing between them since independence in 1947 have left
deep scars, no more so than the almost continuing conflict in the
Kashmir. Pakistani development of nuclear weapons has attracted
international attention and sanctions from the UN. The US is walking a
fine line with Pakistan, needing its support in the region but not
wanting another nuclear power and needing to be seen as hard line
against proliferation.

**India,** has been a nuclear power since 1974 although it maintains a
‘no first use’ policy. India has been an ally of the Soviet Union for
several decades, although the relationship is far from congenial.
Military hardware is purchased from around the world but the
preponderance originates from Soviet or Warsaw Pact. The Soviets
meanwhile, are more concerned with having India as a counterbalance with
China than anything else, however, friction with Pakistan often works in
its favour.

**<u>Islands</u>**: Paradise without the dashboard lights.

**Maldives,** a former British territory has been independent since 1968
and ruled by the same man since 1978. Although there has been a series
of coup attempts, all have failed. The last coup in 1988 was stopped by
an Indian parachute battalion that was flown in to stabilize the regime.
The country consists of 26 atolls and a few isolated island groups with
a population of about 240,000. The Maldives National Defence Force
consists of two helicopters, several Coast Guard Patrol Boats and a
small ‘Rapid Reaction Force’ to provide internal security.

**Mauritius,** colonized first by the Dutch, then the French and finally
the British, it became a Crown Colony in 1968 and then an independent
republic in 1992. Consisting of the main island and several outlying
islands the country is almost the size of Luxembourg and has a
population of just over a half million. The military consists of a small
Coast Guard with two fixed wing (a BN-2T Defender, and a Do228) and
three helicopters (2x Alouette III and an AS355), 10 Patrol Craft (ex
Indian) and a 270-man reaction force.

**Seychelles,** colonized by the French and then controlled by the
British, this country consists of 115 islands and a population of less
than 100,000. Militarily there is a Presidential Protection unit, seven
patrol craft and four aircraft. This country is friendly to both India
and the West.

**British Indian Ocean Territory,** consisting of seven atolls totaling
an area of 60 square kilometers, the largest being Diego Garcia, jointly
used as a base by the British and US. Local people were forced to depart
in the 1960s to allow the construction of the base at Diego Garcia and
the current population of 4000, consists of 2,200 transient military,
1,400 Filipino contract workers and about 300 Mauritians.

**French Southern and Antarctic Lands,** is a group of island groups.
Governed from Paris it has a prefect with a headquarters on Reunion
Island. Total population is about 150 which doubles in the summer.

**The Scenarios:**

This region probably has room for about forty different scenario
situations, but only 10 will form the Indian Ocean Fury battle set.
