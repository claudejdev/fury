**Mediterranean Fury Background**

**Aug 12, 2021**

The conflict in the Mediterranean is critical to the *Northern Fury*
story and runs in parallel to the campaigns in central and northern
Europe as well as other regions of the world. February 1994 finds NATO
in a relatively strong position in the Med; France, Italy and the UK
have forces on higher-than-normal readiness augmenting the US with a
routine deployment of an Aircraft Carrier Battle Group, *USS Eisenhower
(CVN-69)* and an Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) centered on the *USS
Kearsarge (LHD-3)* and *USS Iowa (BB-61).*

Part of the Soviet effort to disperse NATO’s efforts and weaken its
ability to react to any one situation was to invest heavily in training
and surplus equipment for satellite and client countries. Of course, the
main source of this equipment and the training teams that accompanied it
was the former East Germany; the Soviets were quick to commandeer
thousands of tanks and armoured vehicles as well as hundreds of aircraft
and dozens of small ships, which they then re-invested. Two of the most
important recipients of this aid were Syria and Libya, with Algeria
receiving a lesser degree of assistance. As these nations re-equipped,
the Soviets quietly shipped their cast-off hardware to Central America
and Africa as part of a global plan. Although the Soviets made overtures
to Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia, these nations resisted the temptation and
remained neutral or western leaning.

**Libya**: Maintaining his tight rule, the despot Qhadafi ramped up his
anti-west rhetoric and returned to his old ways of launching
provocations in Europe and around the Mediterranean. Better equipment
fostered more confidence, which translated into more aggressive
behaviour. Although European countries, and especially the US, countered
with cruise missile strikes on several occasions, nothing as elaborate
as Operation EL DORADO CANYON took place and Qhadafi simply brushed off
the rebukes and strikes, using them as more fodder for his rhetoric. The
[Libyan military](about:blank#Forces_under_Gaddafi) is large with over
800 combat aircraft, several dozen naval craft, an effective Air Defence
System and an army of over 50,000 troops. These forces have considerable
combat experience, though they have also suffered some major defeats in
combat.

**Syria**: In the *Northern Fury* world, Syria’s Ba’athist regime did
not make a move to cozy up to the west in the early 1990s because its
Soviet benefactor remained strong and helpful. Therefore, Syria did not
join the 1991 Gulf War coalition, though neither did they assist its
troublesome neighbor. Fielding over 600 combat aircraft, 40 vessels and
an army of over 130,000 troops in three corps, Syria’s military was
strong in the 1980s and continued to get stronger with Soviet support.

**Algeria**: In the *Northern Fury* timeline, the 1992 election went
ahead as planned and was not canceled; however, the Islamic Salvation
Front (predicted to win, which historically prompted cancellation of the
election) was the subject of a well orchestrated smear campaign. That,
combined with some selected assassinations and fraudulent election
counting ensured the incumbent Bendjedid government a win that staved
off a civil war. Soviet assistance is suspected. The Algerian military
is large, an army of over 270,000 with about 150 fairly modern aircraft,
several modern surface vessels and two very modern *Kilo*-class
submarines.

**Israel**: Israel remains staunchly pro-western, pro-American, and
anti-Arab in the *Northern Fury* world. Boasting small but powerful,
modern, and battle-tested armed forces, Israel is the military
powerhouse of the region. Politically however, as in the Gulf War,
Israel is worth more to the US and NATO as a silent and neutral partner.
The fear, and probably the reality, is that Arab nations would become
galvanized against any coalition that included Israel. Alienating Egypt,
Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco, or the Gulf States would not be
helpful to NATO’s war effort. The Soviets, however, have no love for
Israel and would be more than happy to cause a rift between it and NATO,
as well as the Arab world.

**Jordan**: The Kingdom of Jordan is a western ally with strong historic
ties to the British and economic ties to the US. Jordan’s military is
also heavily tied to the west with British, American and French
equipment and training. The Army is about 150,000 strong including
reserves and organized on a regional structure. The air force operated
about 60 Mirage F-1s and Northrop F-5s as well as helicopters and
transport aircraft. Since Jordan only has 26 kilometers of coastline,
the Navy’s 20+ fast patrol boats are quite adequate.

**Egypt**: Egypt remains a balancing force in the region, having good
relations with the US, Israel, and the Arab world. Domestically however,
the country was subject to many issues and troubles. Militarily Egypt
was aligning itself with the US, conducting the Bright Star exercise
every 2<sup>nd</sup> year and receiving over 1,000 M-1 Abrams tanks
beginning in 1992. The Army had 340,000 active soldiers and 438,000
reservists organized into 12 mechanized or armoured divisions and
multiple independent brigades. The Airforce flew over 100 F-16s, the
latest being produced by Turkey, 70 Mirage-5s, 20 Mirage 2000s, and many
other aircraft. The Navy operates four submarines and several dozen
other ships.

**Tunisia**: Tunisia is a stable country, completely under the thumb of
President Ben Ali and his corrupt and despotic family. Attempts by the
Soviets to undermine his rule ended badly, mostly for the Tunisian
resistance who hoped for Soviet support. Both France and the US have
been funnelling funds and military hardware towards Tunis for some time,
but that does not guarantee loyalty as Ben Ali is a master at shifting
his country to the winning side to keep his profit margins are high. A
modest air force of between 12 and 20 American Northrop F-5E Tiger IIs
and a navy with three *La Combattante III*-class patrol ships provided
by France form the core of Tunisia’s military. These are augmented by
some Chinese patrol boats. Soviet ships have made regular port calls to
Tunis over the past several years.

**Morocco**: Although King Hassan II has no love for his Spanish
neighbor to the north, the animosity towards Algeria over the long and
bloody war in the Western Sahara keeps him looking north and west for
assistance. There remain six territorial disputes with Spain involving
ports and islands off the northern coast, Spain’s ***plazas de
soberanía.*** Although comprising just over 100 hectors in total, these
are a source of friction, as well as smuggling. Morocco’s military
consists of about 20 Northrop F-5E Tiger IIs and an equal number of
Mirage F.1s, as well as a Spanish *Descubierta*-class corvettes
(*Errhamani)* equipped with Exocet missiles and four *Lazaga*-class
patrol vessels based on the German *Albatros*-class but built in Spain.

**Scenarios**

The scenarios for Mediterranean Fury are closely linked to both Indian
Ocean Fury and Northern Fury. With the outbreak of war, the Atlantic
becomes the highest priority for NATO due to the paramount imperative of
stopping any Soviet surge and securing the northern flank. Of course,
this means that other theaters, irrespective of their own problems,
become a source of resources. Playing through the Mediterranean
scenarios you will constantly be reminded of this conundrum, first
losing key /assets but then benefiting as others come streaming through
your area from the Indian Ocean.

From a NATO perspective, the force posture is strong at sea but somewhat
thin for aircraft. After the Spanish NATO membership referendum in 1986,
the major US airbase at Torrejón was closed and the wing of F-16
fighters (72 front line aircraft plus support) was withdrawn after the
Gulf War in 1991. Further complicating the air situation were the long
running delays to both the Eurofighter Typhoon and the French Rafale,
leaving both the Italians and French operating with some very dated
aircraft. The Italians leased 24 British Tornado Air Defence Variant
(ADV) to fill the gap (18 months early) and the French Navy was
experimenting with American F/A-18A to replace their obsolete F-8
Crusaders, but these are only stop-gaps.

The Soviets have their own problems, though. Constrained geographically
by the Turkish Straits (Bosporus and Dardanelles), they relied on the
Fifth Operational Squadron in the Mediterranean, primarily using bases
in Libya and Syria, to project any sort of military influence. Air
forces as well would either have to be based abroad or fight their way
through Turkey and Greece before reaching the Mediterranean Sea proper.

The Balkans however were a bit of a wild card, being a major concern for
Italy and potentially a major opportunity for the Warsaw Pact. Serbia
was almost de-facto a member of the Warsaw Pact by 1994 (in *Northern
Fury*) and Albania was a corrupt and crumbling state; tensions
throughout the remainder of the Balkans were high as was NATO’s
commitment to the UN Protection Force.
