***ITS Giuseppe Garibaldi, FS Foch, and ESPS Príncipe Asturias***

In a previous Blog we discussed the disposition of the [United States’
Navy’s (USN) aircraft carriers](http://northernfury.us/blog/post8/), and
I said that most other nations operated their carriers differently from
the US. In this Blog will discuss the other NATO carriers existing in
the 1994 setting of *Northern Fury*. Another Blog will discuss [the
Soviet ships](http://northernfury.us/blog/post14/).

John C. Stennis and HMS Illustrious***

There are four nations and nine ships to consider, the United Kingdom
with its three Invincible class ships; ***HMS*** ***Invincible***,
***Illustrious***, and ***Ark Royal***: France with two Clemenceau
class; FS ***Clemenceau*** and ***Foch***: Italy with the ***ITS
Giuseppe Garibaldi*** and Spain with the ***ESPS Príncipe de
Asturias***. In comparing European CVs to those of the USN, it is
probably easier to mention the similarities than to identify the
differences: Firstly, they all operate aircraft, and secondly; they
don’t work alone, but form the flagship of a Task Group. Beyond these
two general statements, US and European carriers are completely
different and fill largely different roles. A simple comparison of some
data on each of the major ship classes shows that the USS Nimitz
displaces over three times the volume of the French Clemenceau class and
more than five times when compared to the more modern NATO ships.
Statistics cannot tell the complete story, but the simple fact is that
the NATO ships cannot, nor are they designed to do the same things as
American carriers.

***So, what you might ask, can these small carriers do? Well the answer
is quite a bit actually.***

**Command & Control (C2):** While small when compared to the American
fleet carriers, these ships are much larger than most other ships
afloat, certainly in their own navies. Therefore, they can house an
Admiral, his staff, a large communications capability, briefing areas
and accommodation for liaison officers and visitors.

**Airborne Early Warning (AEW)**: Although not as capable and far
reaching as the American E-2C Hawkeye, all four countries operating the
smaller carriers use helicopters in this role, three of them; Britain,
Italy and Spain, use a version of the venerable Sea King while the
French use an SA365 Dauphin for this task.

***Royal Navy Sea King HAS.2 AEW***

**Area Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW)**: One of the main roles of the
smaller carriers is to command very capable, often multi-national ASW
forces charged with ‘sanitizing’ an area before other units, such as USN
Carriers or amphibious forces arrive. Indeed, all the CVs mentioned
above except the French Clemenceau class were originally intended for
this role alone, until their nations purchased the Sea Harrier. Also,
two ships not yet discussed are ideal for this task, the French
***Jeanne D’Arc*** which is principally a training ship by 1994 and the
Italian ***Vittorio Veneto***, are truly helicopter carriers (CVH) and
not CVs. While the French use an SA.312 Super Frelon, the other three
use a variant of the Sea King. Both helicopters have a dipping sonar.

***French Navy SA 321G ASW***

**Limited Sea Control:** In addition to ASW, all these carriers can
conduct Sea Control missions, both anti-air and anti-surface; but only
against limited opposition. The key system for this task is the Sea
Harrier for the Spanish, Italians, and British Royal Navy while the
French use a mix of Vietnam era F-8 Crusaders and slightly more modern
Super Etendards. The Difficulty however is numbers. Depending on the
area assigned, as few as six or as many as 14 aircraft can be carried on
each of the British ships while the Italians and Spaniards routinely
carry between six and 12. Although the French will carry 8-10 Crusaders
and 15-16 Super Étendard, the age and limited survivability or
flexibility of these aircraft present their own problems. In *Northern
Fury*, the ***FS Foch*** is experimenting with US F-18s on loan when the
war starts. Both the British and the French have an advantage in this
role with their stand-off air-to-surface missiles, the Sea Eagle and the
Exocet respectively.

***Spanish AV-8S Matador***

**Limited Strike**: Both the Sea Harrier and the Super Étendard have the
ability to conduct strike missions on land targets, but these have to be
tempered with limited numbers and in some cases a restricted ammunition
selection. The British are in the habit of using ground strike Harriers
to augment their Sea Harriers for this role, while the Spanish ‘Matador’
is also quite capable. The Italian Sea Harrier II, however, has a very
narrow munitions menu. The Super Étendard, particularly the upgraded
(Modernisé) version introduced in the early 1990's have a wide selection
of munitions but no precision guided land attack munitions.

***French Super Étendard Modernisé***

**Amphibious Support**: All of these carriers, including the two smaller
CVH, are able to provide support for landing troops from the sea.
Whether it is reconnaissance, strike, troop movement, air superiority,
sea control or simply C2, these vessels are arguably more suited to this
role than the big American super-carriers. Their small size, agility,
and ability to get in close to the shore is a major asset, where the USN
provides aircraft carrying amphibious ships to fulfill this task.

***French CVH Jeanne d'Arc***

**Show of Force**: Although mostly restricted to peacetime operations,
this is a critical element of deploying ships to trouble spots around
the world. These may be small carriers, but in 1994 the only other CVs
in the world are US, Soviet or ex British World War II antiques in
Argentina, Brazil and India (with two, one a relatively modern 1950’s
vintage). So, small is good enough to exert a significant amount of
pressure to resolve a situation in your favor as long as you're not
going up against the big boys. The 1982 Falklands campaign bolstered
this role considerably.

***Italian CVH Vittorio Veneto***

**CV Battle Groups**: These ships, though quite capable, cannot or
should not operate alone. The same way the USN organizes a Battle Group
of escorts around its carriers, any CV, no matter how small will have an
escort. Although they will vary widely and be much smaller for the CVHs,
every carrier will usually be accompanied by an air defence ship and one
or probably two ASW ships. France will use the Suffern class as the air
defence shooter and the Tourville or Leygues class for ASW. Britain will
almost always have at least one Type 42 and two Type 22 ships as escort.
The Italians will use an Audace class for its air defence and Maestrale
class for ASW. The Spanish will use a mix of Santa Maria and Baleares
class frigates. National support and supply ships (AOR) will often be in
company with the carriers, or close by.

These ships then, may be small in comparison to US Super Carriers but
they are a significant investment in national capitol, training,
commitment and strength. They are also powerful in their own right when
used in the proper scenario. Although not meant to charge into heavily
defended bastions; they are meant to do many other jobs, thus allowing
the concentration of US CV/CVNs to conduct high intensity power
projection.
