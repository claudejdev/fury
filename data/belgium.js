  'The Belgian army fields a Corps sized force with five active Brigades, four within the Corps and the Para-Commando Brigade. The Corps HQ, 16th Division, portions of 1st Division and many of the Corps Troops are located in Germany in the Soest Area; 250Km East of the Belgian border. Up to 40,000 of the 68,000 regular soldiers in the Belgian Army were stationed in Germany. The Para Commando Bde is assigned to the AMF (ACE \\[Allied Command Europe\\] Mobile Force) and expected to deploy to North Norway in an emergency.\n\n![](images/belgium army/belgianArmy1.jpg)\n\n![](images/belgium army/belgianArmy2.jpg) **Leopard I**: The main battle tank of the Belgian Army is the Leopard I, and eight tank regiments (battalions) were each equipped with 40 (3x Coy of 13 + 1 Command). Each Mechanized Brigade had one unit, 17th Armoured Brigade had two and the eighth was the ‘2nd Jaagers te Paard‘, a reconnaissance unit.\n\n**AIFV-B**: The Belgian Army‘s main Infantry Combat Vehicle is the AIFV-B. This is a development of the ubiquitous M-113 but improved to provide infantry with improved fire power, Halon fire suppression systems and better suspension. 514 AIFV-B‘s were purchased in addition to 525 M113A-B. ![](images/belgium army/belgianArmy3.jpg) About half of the AIFV-B‘s were equipped with the 25mm gun, while most of the remainder had a .50 Calibre Heavy Machine Gun, many of the M113‘s were the 81mm Mortar or Milan ATGM variants. These vehicles were delivered in the late 80‘s to replace the AMX-VCI family of APCs, up to 500 of which were still available in 1994.\n\n**Artillery**: 1st Belgian Corps fields a wide variety of artillery including 117 M109A2 and 41 M109A3 155mm Self Propelled guns, 11 M110 203mm and numerous older pieces and 5 Lance Missile Launchers.\n\n![](images/belgium army/belgianArmy4.jpg)\n\nM109A3 SP Howitzer, 155mm.

  'The Belgian Navy is the smallest service in the country by far, with only about 4,500 regular members and an equal number of reservists. Unlike their Dutch, French and British neighbors, the Belgian Naval Force (the official name until 2002) does not have a centuries old tradition of exploring the globe, but has a much shorter and humbler history. Within NATO they focus on keeping the English Channel and key ports of North West Europe clear of mines.\n\n![](images/belgium navy/belgianNavy1.jpg) **Frigates**: The four Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW) Frigates of the Wielingen class are quite modest in size and armament. At 2,200 tons with a 100mm gun, a single Sea Sparrow air defence missile launcher and eight missiles, four Exocet anti ship missiles and ASW weapons, these ships are limited in their employability in a high threat area. All are base at Zeebrugge. F 913 Ran aground in 1988 while on an exercise in Norway, as a result she was repaired in dry dock and deployed again in 1992, but was the first to suffer from the ‘Peace Dividend‘ and was decommissioned sometime between 1993 and 1995 (references vary).

  'Belgium maintained a powerful Air Force in the later Cold War era, however, they were quick to try and cash in on the ‘Peace Dividend‘ when the Berlin Wall fell and most thought that the Cold war was ending. Luckily, the coup in Moscow reversed the trend in Brussels and although several squadrons were on the verge of standing down, they were kept, initially at a lower state of readiness but as tension with a resurgent Soviet Union heightened in 91/92, training increased and new weapons were purchased. The Belgian Air Force was committed to 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force (2 ATAF) on the Central front over Germany.\n\n![](images/belgian air force/belgianAir1.jpg) **F-16**: Belgium and the Netherlands formed a production consortium to build F-16s in Europe, eventually producing over 500 of them primarily for Norway, Denmark and themselves. By 1991 the second major purchase order had been completed with a total of 136 ‘A‘ models and 24 ‘B‘ models. The earlier production examples were rebuilt to the Block 10 standard, bringing the entire fleet to the Block 10/15 standard by 92, with the final 40 being at the improved ‘OCU‘ (Operational Capability Upgrade) standard.\n\nHistorically, Belgium obtained 72 Aim-120 AMRAAM and 12 AGM-65 missiles in 1995. Northern Fury has them acquiring these munitions in 1993, and the quantities increased to 140 AMRAAM and 36 Mavericks.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nA/C\n\nType\n\n1\n\nStingers\n\nFlorennes\n\n20\n\nF-16A OCU\n\n2\n\nComet\n\nFlorennes\n\n20\n\nF-16A OCU\n\n23\n\nDevils\n\nKleine Brogel\n\n24\n\nF-16A\n\n31\n\nTigers\n\nKleine Brogel\n\n24\n\nF-16A\n\n349\n\nMace\n\nBeauvechain\n\n24\n\nF-16A\n\n350\n\nAmbiorix\n\nBeauvechain\n\n24\n\nF-16A\n\nOCU\n\nVulture\n\nBeauvechain\n\n24\n\nF-16B\n\n![](images/belgian air force/belgianAir2.jpg) **Mirage 5**: Two squadrons of Dassault Mirage 5‘s remain active in the Belgian Air Force, one attack squadron and one reconnaissance squadron.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nA/C\n\nType\n\n8\n\nBlue Cocotte\n\nBierset\n\n36\n\nMirage 5BA\n\n42\n\nMephisto\n\nBierset\n\n22\n\nMirage 5BR\n\nOCU\n\nBierset\n\n16\n\nMirage 5BD\n\n![](images/belgian air force/belgianAir3.jpg) **Alpha Jet**: Initial operational training in both air to air and air to ground combat is conducted in the Alpha Jets of 7th and 33rd Squadrons.
