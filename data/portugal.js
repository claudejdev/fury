  'The Portuguese Air Force is in transition. After several decades focusing on Colonial issues, primarily in Africa, the Força Aérea Portuguesa are struggling to dispose of older 1950‘s based aircraft and become more modern. World tension however is making that difficult. Without a domestic aircraft industry to speak of, Portugal is at the mercy of suppliers. Because it allows the US to use the key base at Lajes on the Azores Portugal is now, after significant diplomatic effort, being compensated and is in the process of receiving their first Squadron of F-16‘s from the US, against the wishes of the USAF which is working hard to use every F-16 available. The first 6 of 20 F-16‘s have been delivered (6 months earlier than historic, 4x F-16OCU (Blk 15) and 2 F-16B).\n\n![](images/portuguese air force/image001.jpg)\n\nPortuguese Air Force Jet in Flight\n\n  \n\n**A-7 Corsair**: A large portion of the Portuguese air force is committed to the A-7P light attack aircraft which were second hand US Navy aircraft upgraded to the latest variant. Two Squadrons operate out of Monte Real. These 30-year-old aircraft are rugged but well used and are due to be replaced by F-16s.\n\n![](images/portuguese air force/image003.jpg)\n\nA-7 Corsair\n\n  \n\n**Alpha Jet**: In another ‘Aircraft for Base‘ deal, Germany has supplied Portugal with 50 Dornier Alpha Jets as compensation for using the base at Beja as the Luftwaffe‘s air combat training base. Although Germany was going to renege on the deal, pressure from the US, UK, France and Spain convinced them to deliver. These aircraft replaced the aging Fiat G.91s in the close support role and the 1950‘s era Cessna T-37 Tweet in the attack training role.\n\n![](images/portuguese air force/image007.jpg)\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n  \n\n**C-130 Hercules**: The Portuguese operate 6 ‘H‘ model Hercules, although 3 are more modern H2 and H3 versions. Tactual transport and general duties keep these workhorses quite busy.\n\n![](images/portuguese air force/image005.jpg)\n\nC-130 Hercules\n\n  \n\n**C-212 Avocar**: A very versatile, European built tactical transport that has many variants. Shown here is the Maritime Patrol Variant with a radar in the nose and a magnetic anomaly detector along the forward fuselage. Electronic Warfare, Photo Reconnaissance and general transport variants are also used by the Portuguese Air Force.\n\n![](images/portuguese air force/image009.jpg)\n\nC-212 Avocar\n\n  \n\n**P3P Orion**: The Portuguese Air Force, which is also responsible for Maritime Patrol and support to the Portuguese Navy has been operating the P-3 Orion since 1985. These six aircraft were surplus Australian P-3Bs upgraded to a ‘C‘ standard. Flown by 601 Squadron Lobos (Wolves) they operate out of Beja but routinely have aircraft at Lejes in the Azores. This unit operates with both American and Spanish P-3‘s conducting ASW duties in the Eastern Atlantic and particularly on the approaches to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\n\\# of AC\n\nType of AC\n\n103\n\nCaracóis\n\nBeja\n\n24\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n201\n\nFalcons\n\nMonte Real\n\n4\n\nF-16A\n\n301\n\nJaguars\n\nBeja\n\n24\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n302\n\nRoyal Eagles\n\nMonte Real\n\n20\n\nA-7P\n\n304\n\nMagnificos\n\nMonte Real\n\n20\n\nA-7P\n\n401\n\nScientists\n\nMontijo\n\n6\n\nC-212 (MPA, PR, EW)\n\n501\n\nBison\n\nMontijo\n\n6\n\nC-130H\n\n502\n\nElephant\n\nMontijo\n\n8\n\nC-212\n\n503\n\nDolphins\n\nLajes\n\n8\n\nC-212\n\n504\n\nLynxes\n\nLisbon\n\n2\n\nFalcon 50\n\n551\n\nAligators\n\nMontijo\n\n24\n\nAlouette III SA 319\n\n552\n\nDrones\n\nBeja\n\n24\n\nAlouette III SA 319\n\n601\n\nLobos\n\nBeja\n\n6\n\nP-3P Orion\n\n![](images/portuguese air force/image011.jpg)\n\nP3P Orion',

  '**Portuguese Navy** - The Portuguese Navy (_Marinha de Guerra Portuguesa_) traces its history back to the 12th Century through colonial exploration to the modern day. Unfortunately, most of Portugal‘s ships lightly armed and designed for overseas duties in a low threat environment, although they were effective in exerting influence in former colonies they are rather anemic by European and North Atlantic standards. A agreement with Britain to purchase the Rover Class fleet support tanker (RFA Blue Rover) was not executed in the Northern Fury world, leaving the Portuguese Navy dependent on others for at sea replenishment.\n\n![](images/portuguese navy/image001.jpg)\n\nVasco Da Gama Class\n\n**Vasco Da Gama Class**: As an exception to the rule, these three ships were commissioned in 1991 and 92, and are based on the German MEKO 200 design. They are capable patrol ships but lack variable depth sonar or area air defence systems. They carry two Lynx helicopters, Harpoon Missiles and Sea Sparrow short range air defence. All are based in Lisbon.\n\nPennant\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nF330\n\nVasco da Gama\n\nGibralter\n\nF331\n\nÁlvares Cabral\n\nLisbon\n\nF332\n\nCorte-Real\n\nAzors\n\n![](images/portuguese navy/image004.jpg)\n\nJoão Coutinho Class\n\n**João Coutinho Class**: These 25-year-old ships were small and inexpensive to operate, but with the correlation that they were very poorly equipped in either weapons or sensors.

The original intent of this class is somewhat of a mystery, there is a good chance that they were destined to be delivered to South Africa during the Arms Embargo that was preventing any modernization, that obviously did not happen.

    portugal_army:
  'The Portuguese army is a small conscript force which maintains key functions at high readiness and maintains basic skill sets for rapid mobilization. Structurally they have a Corps HQ, but in reality this formation would function at the Divisional level and either remain in Portugal to enable mobilization or deploy with the Mechanized Brigade to NATO‘s Southern Army Group (SOUTHAG). The standing army was 44,000 personnel with about 175,000 reserves. ![](images/Portuguese Army_files/image001.png)\n\nThe majority of the Portuguese Army is ‘light‘. The units are either specialized light infantry such as the Paratroop Brigade which is controlled by the Air Force, the Marines which are controlled by the Navy or the Commandos who are tasked by the national HQ, or lightly equipped regional forces. The one mechanized formation ‘1a Brigada Mista Independiente‘ or 1st Mixed Brigade has an armored battalion (M60A3 TTS), a mechanized battalion (M-113) and a motorized battalion (trucks). The garrison units are unique; they are based on a light infantry battalion but have a battery of 105mm artillery, a reconnaissance squadron and air defence.\n\n![](images/Portuguese Army_files/image002.jpg) **[M60A3 TTS Main Battle Tank (MBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M60_Patton#Variants)**: The US provided Portugal with 93 M60A3 TTS as well as several bridge layer, engineering, recovery and driver training variants in 1991. These replaced M-48s which were returned to the US. These are standard M60A3 with a Thermal imaging targeting site added to improve night and poor visibility operations. Most, (53) of these MBTs are in the Armored Battalion of the Mixed Brigade while the remainder are in the Cavalry (Reconnaissance) Squadron and training school.\n\n![](images/Portuguese Army_files/image003.jpg) **[M113](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M113_armored_personnel_carrier)**: The Mechanized Battalion of the Mixed Brigade operates 42 of the 123 M113 Armored Personnel Carriers in the Portuguese Army. Other variants of this family of vehicles being used are the command post (M577), the TOW missile carrier (M901), the 107mm mortar carrier (M106) and the 81mm mortar carrier (M125), and 20mm Vulcan (M163A1). The remainder of the M113s are spread throughout the regional brigades and training schools.\n\n![](images/Portuguese Army_files/image004.jpg)\n\n5.5 Inch Gun\n\n**Artillery**: Portugal employed a wide variety of artillery systems.\n\n*   23x 5.5 inch guns\n*   6x M109A2 SP 155mm Howitzer\n*   40x M114/23 Towed 155mm Howitzer\n*   60x M-101 Towed 105mm Howitzer\n*   6x M108 Self Propelled (SP) 105mm Howitzer\n\n![](images/Portuguese Army_files/image006.jpg)\n\nRH202 20mm AA Gun\n\n**Air Defence Systems**: Portugal has a large number of light air defence systems.\n\n*   332x Bofors, 40mmL/70 Towed AA Guns\n*   30x RH202, 20mm Towed AA Guns\n*   34x M163A1 20mm Vulcan SP AA Guns\n*   57x Blowpipe SAM',

  'One of the 12 founding members of NATO, Portugal with a population of 10 million and a low GDP was also the poorest by most measurements. Ultra-ideological policies, a transition from colonialism to socialism and then finally to a liberal democracy, all leaving the economy in a state of turmoil requiring the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to step in with stabilization programs in the 70‘s and again in the 80‘s. After joining the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1986, the economy improved substantially.\n\nThe troubled political and economic situation did not leave much room for military growth. Although one of the smaller militaries in NATO, Portugal maintains several key bases, critical for security of trans- Atlantic commerce, particularly Lejas in the Azors but also the Cape Verde Islands and Madeira. Germany also uses the Portuguese base of Baja for its air combat training, and the HQ for Commander - in- Chief Iberian Atlantic (CINCIBERLANT) is located just west of Lisbon at Oeiras.',
