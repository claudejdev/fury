  '**French Air Force (Armée de l‘air or Air Army)** - The French Air Force is one of the largest in Europe with 93,000 personnel and over 70000 reserves. Maintaining over 450 combat aircraft, a strategic and a tactical nuclear capability and significant support and transport elements, the French Air Force is critical to the defence of Europe. The Air Force is divided into four major commands: Strategic Air Force (CoFAS) operating IRBMs (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles), bombers and refueling aircraft; Tactical Air Force (FATac) operates most of the strike aircraft; Aid Defense Command (CAFDA) operating Fighter Interceptors; and Air Transport Command (CoTAM) operating transport and helicopter squadrons. Centrally controlled are 4 E-3F AWACS.\n\n![](images/france air force/image002.jpg) **Strategic Air Force (CoFAS)** - CoFAS operates the 91st bombardment wing with two squadrons of Mirage IV-P (18) nuclear bombers and one squadron of Mirage IV-R (12) in the reconnaissance role, the 94th bombardment wing providing training and conversion with Mirage IV-A (12) and IV-P(4), and an IRBM wing of two squadrons (18 silos). Supporting the Mirage IV-P was an air refueling wing of 3 KC-135F Squadrons (12 total).\n\n![](images/france air force/image004.jpg) **Mirage IV** - The Mirage IV was twice the weight and 1.5 times the length of its predecessor the Mirage III (more later), which allowed for massive fuel tanks. Even though this aircraft was a bomber - all ordinance was attached externally, that and the extra fuel storage allowed for high speed and long range.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nGroup\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\nEB 1/91\n\nGascogne\n\nMont-de-Marsan\n\nCoFAS\n\n9\n\nMirage IV-P\n\nEB 2/91\n\nBretagne\n\nCazaux\n\nCoFAS\n\n9\n\nMirage IV-P\n\nEB 3/91\n\nBeauvaisis\n\nCreil\n\nCoFAS\n\n12\n\nMirage IV-R\n\nEB 1/93\n\nGuyenne\n\nIstres\n\nCoFAS\n\n4\n\nKC-135F\n\nEB 2/93\n\nCevennes\n\nOrange\n\nCoFAS\n\n4\n\nKC-135F\n\nEB 3/93\n\nSambre\n\nCambrie\n\nCoFAS\n\n4\n\nKC-135F\n\nEB 1/94\n\nBourbonnais\n\nAvord\n\nCoFAS\n\n6\n\nMirage IVA\n\nEB 2/94\n\nMarne\n\nSt Dizier\n\nCoFAS\n\n6\n\nMirage IVA\n\nEB 3/94\n\nArbois\n\nLuxeuil\n\nCoFAS\n\n4\n\nMirage IVP\n\n![](images/france air force/image005.jpg)\n\nMirage IV\n\n  \n\n#### Aid Defense Command (CAFDA)\n\nCAFDA operates 4 wings of fighter interceptors focusing on the Air Defence and Air Superiority tasks. Comprising 13 squadrons (escadron de chasse, translated ‘Pursuit Squadron‘ or EC) equipped with two versions of Dassault Mirage aircraft, this force also had expeditionary tasks to Djibouti and the Persian Gulf.\n\n![](images/france air force/image006.jpg) **Mirage F1C & F1C-200** - Of the 162 F1C‘s that entered service with the French Airforce, half were equipped with a refueling capability (F1C-200) for expeditionary operations, and beginning in 1991, 55 were converted to the F1CT strike fighter and transferred to the FATac. In 1994 the 82 F1C‘s and 25 remaining F1C-200‘s formed the core of two interceptor wings, the 12th with four squadrons, and the 30th with three squadrons.\n\n![](images/france air force/image008.jpg) **Mirage 2000C** - The Mirage 2000C was designed as a modern interceptor with a secondary strike role. This aircraft was meant to be the French answer to the F-16 and has certainly evolved into multiple variants and roles and has been exported to eight other countries, total production is about 600 compared to almost 5000 F-16‘s. Two wings, the 2nd and 5th each have three squadrons of these aircraft.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nGroup\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\nEC 1/2\n\nCigognes\n\nDijon\n\nCAFDA\n\n18\n\nMirage 2000C\n\nEC 2/2\n\nCote d‘or\n\nDijon\n\nCAFDA\n\n18\n\nMirage 2000C\n\nEC 3/2\n\nAlsace\n\nDijon\n\nCAFDA\n\n18\n\nMirage 2000C\n\nEC 1/5\n\nIll de France\n\nOrange\n\nCAFDA\n\n18\n\nMirage 2000C\n\nEC 2/5\n\nIll de France\n\nOrange\n\nCAFDA\n\n18\n\nMirage 2000C\n\nEC 3/5\n\nIll de France\n\nOrange\n\nCAFDA\n\n18\n\nMirage 2000C\n\nEC 1/12\n\nCambresis\n\nCambrie\n\nCAFDA\n\n15\n\nMirage F1C\n\nEC 2/12\n\nPicardie\n\nCambrie\n\nCAFDA\n\n15\n\nMirage F1C\n\nEC 3/12\n\nComouaile\n\nCambrie\n\nCAFDA\n\n15\n\nMirage F1C\n\nEC 4/12\n\nBalbuzard\n\nCambrie\n\nCAFDA\n\n15\n\nMirage F1C\n\nEC 1/30\n\nValois\n\nMarsan\n\nCAFDA\n\n15\n\nMirage F1C\n\nEC 2/30\n\nNormandie\n\nMarsan\n\nCAFDA\n\n15\n\nMirage F1C\n\nEC 3/30\n\nLorraine\n\nMarsan\n\nCAFDA\n\n15\n\nMirage F1C\n\n**Tactical Air Force (FATac)** - FATac comprises a large segment of the French Air Force, with 25 Squadrons there have been several variations from history in the Northern Fury world. The role of this group is to conduct both conventional and nuclear strike missions in a high threat environment. Thus, not only strike aircraft are required, but reconnaissance, and electronic warfare as well.\n\n![](images/france air force/image010.jpg)**Mirage F1CR** - A reconnaissance version of the baseline interceptor, this aircraft has a secondary ground attack role. 64 were built and they equipped three squadrons of the 33rd wing at Strasbourg.\n\n**Mirage F1CT** - Yet another version of the Mirage F1, 55 of the CT or strike variants were converted from the F1C-200‘s in 91-92. Historically they replaced a Jaguar wing but in Northern Fury they formed a new wing, the 6th which also took on the role of providing the contingent in Djibouti. These aircraft look identical to the reconnaissance version.\n\n![](images/france air force/image013.jpg)**Mirage 5F** - This aircraft, a derivative of the Mirage III was meant for export, in particular to Israel. Do to political tension over the 1967 Arab/Israeli war, France embargoed the sale of these aircraft. Although Israel had paid for the jets, and several attempts to obtain them were made, the 50 aircraft were eventually adopted into the Armée de l‘air as the Mirage 5F. They were designed for the clear weather ground attack role and were operated by the 13th wing at Colmar.\n\n**Mirage 2000N** - This is two seat version of the basic fighter and is designed specifically for tactical nuclear weapon delivery. Its wings are strengthened for low level flight, an electronic countermeasures suite, and it has a precision navigation system with terrain avoidance radar. 75 of this version were produced and operated by four squadrons of the 4th wing at Luxeuil\n\n![](images/france air force/image015.jpg)**Mirage 2000D** - This is the multi-role, two seat version of the basic Air Superiority design and very similar to the 2000N. This aircraft is designed for delivering conventional munitions and has been modernized from the 2000N with improved radar and a digital cockpit. Historically it entered service in 1994/95 but in Northern Fury it arrives three years earlier and 72 of a planned 96 have been built. Both wings equipped with this aircraft are housed at Nancy, the 3rd was historically the first wing converted and also a new wing, the 20th forming to allow yet another Jaguar wing to be retained.\n\n![](images/france air force/image016.jpg)**SEPECAT Jaguar** - Unique in the Armée de l‘air‘s fighter aircraft, the Jaguar was not produced by Dessault! SEPECAT is a consortium of Breguet and British Aircraft Corporation (now BAE Systems). These very agile, rugged and versatile fighters equipped nine squadrons at one point but that has now been reduced to six. Until the introduction of Mirage 2000N, the Jaguar maintained the tactical nuclear role. Although largely retired by 1994 they have been retained in the Northern Fury world.\n\nSqn Name Location Group No. Type\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nGroup\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\nEC 1/3\n\nNavarre\n\nNancy\n\nFATac\n\n12\n\nMirage 2000D\n\nEC 2/3\n\nChampagne\n\nNancy\n\nFATac\n\n12\n\nMirage 2000D\n\nEC 3/3\n\nArdennes\n\nNancy\n\nFATac\n\n12\n\nMirage 2000D\n\nEC 1/4\n\nDauphine\n\nLuxeuil\n\nFATac\n\n18\n\nMirage 2000N\n\nEC 2/4\n\nLafayette\n\nLuxeuil\n\nFATac\n\n18\n\nMirage 2000N\n\nEC 3/4\n\nLuxeuil\n\nFATac\n\n18\n\nMirage 2000N\n\nEC 4/4\n\nLuxeuil\n\nFATac\n\n18\n\nMirage 2000N\n\nEC 1/6\n\nColmar\n\nFATac\n\n16\n\nMirage F1CT\n\nEC 2/6\n\nColmar\n\nFATac\n\n16\n\nMirage F1CT\n\nEC 3/6\n\nColmar\n\nFATac\n\n12\n\nMirage F1CT\n\nEC 4/6\n\nVexin\n\nDjibouti\n\nFATac\n\n8\n\nMirage F1CT\n\nEC 1/7\n\nProvence\n\nSt Dizier\n\nFATac\n\n18\n\nJaguar\n\nEC 2/7\n\nArgonne\n\nSt Dizier\n\nFATac\n\n18\n\nJaguar\n\nEC 3/7\n\nLanguedoc\n\nSt Dizier\n\nFATac\n\n18\n\nJaguar\n\nEC 1/11\n\nRoussillon\n\nToul\n\nFATac\n\n18\n\nJaguar\n\nEC 2/11\n\nVosges\n\nToul\n\nFATac\n\n18\n\nJaguar\n\nEC 3/11\n\nCorse\n\nToul\n\nFATac\n\n18\n\nJaguar\n\nEC 1/13\n\nArtois\n\nColmar\n\nFATac\n\n15\n\nMirage 5F\n\nEC 2/13\n\nAlps\n\nColmar\n\nFATac\n\n15\n\nMirage 5F\n\nEC 3/13\n\nColmar\n\nColmar\n\nFATac\n\n15\n\nMirage 5F\n\nEC 1/20\n\nNementcha\n\nNancy\n\nFATac\n\n12\n\nMirage 2000D\n\nEC 2/20\n\nOranie\n\nNancy\n\nFATac\n\n12\n\nMirage 2000D\n\nEC 3/20\n\nOuarsenis\n\nNancy\n\nFATac\n\n12\n\nMirage 2000D\n\nCR 1/33\n\nBelfort\n\nStrasbourg\n\nFATac\n\n16\n\nMirage F.1CR\n\nCR 2/33\n\nSavoie\n\nStrasbourg\n\nFATac\n\n16\n\nMirage F.1CR\n\nCR 3/33\n\nMosell\n\nStrasbourg\n\nFATac\n\n16\n\nMirage F.1CR\n\n**Air Transport Command (CoTAM)** - CoTAM is a large command with 28 squadrons: ten fixed wing; 12 rotary wing; six overseas based squadrons which were uniquely tailored to the requirements of the post; and a VIP transport element.',

  'Although France is not part of the NATO military alliance, its forces are earmarked to reinforce NATO, and although they are not integrated as other NATO counties, there is an understanding of commitment. I Northern Fury, France Declares itself a full NATO partner within hours of the war starting and the Armed Forces of France come under the NATO military command structure.\n\nThe French Army is large, 296,000 active and over 400,000 reserve soldiers. It is however, organized quite differently from most NATO nations. Brigade HQs have been removed and units report directly to the Division HQ, also most divisions are about half the strength of their NATO counterparts and the ‘Light Armoured‘ Divisions are about the size of a typical NATO Brigade. 1st French Army is assigned to deploy to Germany as part of CENTAG (Central Army Group) while the Force d‘Action Rapide will deploy to NORTHAG (Northern Army Group). In addition to these deployable forces, there are six Territorial Defence Regions with assigned troops, the Gendarmerie (para military police force), the French Foreign Legion (mostly in central and northern Africa) and forces overseas in former colonies throughout Africa, Djbouti, Reunion Islands, the French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Caribbean and supporting Coalition operations in the Persian Gulf.\n\n![](images/france army/image002.png)\n\n  \n\n![](images/france army/image004.jpg) **Leclerc**: The French Army was in the initial stages of re-equipping its forces with this new Main Battle Tank (MBT) when Northern Fury occurs. This tank with very modern fire control, advanced armour and a 120mm gun was easily the equivalent of the M1A2 or the Leopard 2 in many respects, probably superior in some areas, and certainly a match for anything the Soviet forces had available at the time. Production commenced in 1992, with the first unit equipped by the end of 1993. Within 2e Régiment de Chasseurs, part of 10th Armoured Division is equipped with 80 of these new tanks, while further production continues at an increased pace.\n\n**AMX 30**: The standard MBT of the French Army, 1,355 of the original AMX 30 were accepted into service and in the 80‘s and early 90‘s the final 271 production tanks and 820 conversions ![](images/france army/image006.jpg)(as originally planned and more than historic) were to the AMX 30 B2 standard with an improved fire control system, a better engine. The non-stabilized 105mm gun puts this in an equivalent class to the American M60A1 or the Soviet T-62 - a good tank but not in the same league as the latest NATO or WP competitors. Many variants were produced, including an Air Defence version with Roland missiles, a Self Propelled Gun, engineering variants and even 44 ‘Pluton‘ tactical nuclear missile launchers.\n\n![](images/france army/image008.jpg) **Armoured Cars**: The French Army had various armoured cars for divers usage, mostly in the Light Armoured Divisions and reconnaissance roles. Over 425 AML-60 remained in service from an original procurement of over 3000, although there were several hundred in reserve. These are used in a reconnaissance role in most divisions and in the Foreign Legion but also provided the basis of a complete family of vehicles with many variations. The French Gendarmerie also use over one hundred examples of this vehicle.\n\n![](images/france army/image010.jpg) One of the more prolific variants of the AML was the AML-90 with a 90mm low velocity gun (short recoil). The Army uses 210 of these variants in the Light Armoured Divisions, reconnaissance units and for specialized units in other divisions. The Gendarmerie and Foreign Legion also uses this type.\n\n![](images/france army/image012.jpg) A more modern vehicle was needed to replace the AML-90 and in the early 80‘s the ERC-90 was produced. Also with a 90mm gun but this was a smooth-bore cannon which allowed the firing of improved Armour-Piercing, Fin-Stabilized, discarding Sabot (APFSDS) ammunition. This improvement enabled a much better capacity to destroy older type Soviet tanks and other armoured vehicles out to a range of 2000 meters. Only 192 of these armoured cars entered service with the Marines, Airborne and Alpine divisions.\n\n![](images/france army/image014.jpg) A more effective vehicle to support light forces is found in the AMX-10RC, which is a heavier 6-wheeled armoured car with a 105mm medium velocity gun. 284 of these vehicles can be round in the tank destroyer and reconnaissance roles in light armoured divisions, mechanized divisions, 9th Marine division and the Foreign Legion. The very capable gun is designed to be fired from light vehicles such as this and with specialized ammunition can penetrated the side of a Soviet MBT at 2000 meters. The hydropneumatic suspension is adaptive and allows for both high speeds and a low profile when needed.\n\n![](images/france army/image016.jpg) **Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC)**: Like most French vehicles, their APCs were all French designed and built, with a mind for the export market. Also these vehicles were only the base and spawned many variations. The tracked APC (AMX-10P) had 15 different variants fielded while the wheeled APC (VAB) developed a staggering 35 variants from a riot control vehicle to Milan and HOT ATGM (Anti-Tank Guided Missile) launcher. All examples of these two vehicle families had NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection and were amphibious.\n\nThe tracked AMX-10P was used primarily in the mechanized infantry units of the heavy armoured divisions and their supporting artillery observers. Over 1500 of the base model with a 20mm autocannon were delivered as well as ambulance, recovery, ATGM, artillery observer, radar, mortar and mortar tractors, command, and cargo variants.\n\nThe wheeled counterpart to the AMX-10 is the VAB (Véhicule de l‘Avant Blindé or Vanguard Armoured Vehicle). This was the most numerous APC in the French Army by a long margin with over 4000 in the inventory and over 1000 more produced for export. These are built in both a 4-wheel and 6-wheel configuration but the vast majority in French service are the 4-wheeled variety. This vehicle is amphibious, lightly armoured and armed and extremely versatile. Every division has at least one unit equipped with the VAB and dozens of variants are in use throughout the force.\n\n![](images/france army/image020.jpg)\n\nVAB firing a HOT Anti-Tank Guided Missile.\n\n  \n\n![](images/france army/image022.jpg) **Artillery**: The French produce GCT was a 155mm howitzer built on an AMX 30 chassis. The gun provided NBC protection, and auto-loader enabling a rate of fire of 6-8 rounds per minute out to a range of 23,500 meters. Using rocket assisted projectiles the range increased to 28,000 meters. By 1994, 253 GCTs were in service, replacing most of the old and unprotected Mk3 guns produced in the 50‘s.\n\nNumerous older 155mm and 105mm artillery systems were in use in various roles within the French army.',
    france:
  'Although France left the NATO military command structure in 1966, it was one of the 12 founding members. In Northern Fury, France rejoins NATO within 7 hours of the war starting.\n\nThe significant military inventory fielded by France is hindered in several ways: The near 30 year absence from NATO means that interoperability with other nations has suffered; France‘s defence industry had fallen behind technologically in some areas leading to long development times (Rafale took 25 years from contract to fielding), excessive build times (12 years for the Aircraft Carrier Charles De Gaulle), nether of which are available for Northern Fury; Limited sales within NATO but significant sales to potential enemies (Dassault Mirage type fighters, Exocet SSMs, Crotale SAMs etc); Several unique but dated doctrinal anomalies remain within the French structure, (Light Armoured Divisions etc).',
