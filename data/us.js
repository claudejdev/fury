The new regime in Moscow develop a bold and risky plan to re-establish a balance of power where they have exerted their might and regain recent losses in status and power.\n\nStrategically the Soviets wish to destabilize the emerging European Union and shatter NATO as an alliance. To achieve this they will:\n\n*   Envelope Central Europe with the Northern Arm through Norway and the Southern Arm through Germany, seizing Berlin, Copenhagen and Oslo as bargaining chips in the process.\n*   Interdict in the North Atlantic by seizing Iceland and disrupting US reinforcements to NATO and the supply of general cargo to Western Europe.\n*   Distract and cause confusion in the Indian Ocean, Caribbean and Mediterranean regions with a view to tying down forces that would otherwise reinforce Europe and sewing unrest in non-aligned countries.\n*   Focus attention in the Western Pacific by destabilizing South Korea, Japan and the Philippines.\n*   To remove focus from Europe the Soviets will foster unrest in Africa, urge Argentina to re-attack the Falklands, assist North Korea hoping they would attack South Korea, and precipitate war between India & Pakistan.\n*   Neutralize NATO‘s Nuclear Triad by remaining strictly conventional in all actions, and messaging the futility and vulnerability of general nuclear exchange through every means possible throughout the West.',
  overview:
   '### Northern Fury (Alternate Cold War History)\n\nOn the 19th of August 1991, hard-liners in the Soviet leadership, calling themselves the ‘State Emergency Committee‘, launched the ‘August Coup‘ in order to remove Gorbachev from power and prevent the signing of the new union treaty. Although experiencing some initial setbacks and resounding world condemnation - the coup was a success. The concepts of Perestroika and Glasnost, and the economic and political restructuring they implied, were abolished overnight. Independence movements in 14 states were ruthlessly quashed, including those in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Georgia where self-rule had already been declared. Internal strife reminiscent of the 1920‘s lasted for just over a month but the iron rule of the reinvigorated Communist Party prevailed in all areas.\n\nNATO watched nervously as their efforts to encourage Eastern European countries away from Dictatorship were methodically dashed. Only Poland and the re-unified Germany managed to avoid the restoration of the Warsaw Pact. Poland has declared itself Neutral and Non-aligned; however significant pro Eastern Bloc movements exist and are in a constant struggle with its emerging Capitalist economy. Germany is in a difficult position as many of its Left Wing political elements have been proposing the abandonment of collective defense as a viable strategy for the future.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO was decisively engaged as its (original 16) various governments were attempting to realize the ‘peace dividend‘ by reducing military forces, and employing what is left in non-traditional roles in order to justify costs. With significantly reduced Land, Sea and Air forces embroiled in the Balkans, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Rwanda and The Sudan. Resources are spread thinner than they have been since the 1940‘s. Tensions with Iraq are high and the threat to stability in the Middle East is extreme.\n\nOn the 9th of February 1994, a Soviet supported Coup toppled the Polish government and sent the emergent democratic state into anarchy. The UN Security council response was futile and an emergency sitting of NATO‘s North Atlantic Council (NAC) was called for the 12th of February.\n\nIn Norway - The International Olympic Committee (IOC), in consultation with the UN decided to carry on with the Winter Games which were opened in Lillehammer, on February 12th. Soviet and Eastern Bloc countries were represented at the opening ceremonies but many of their athletes were not present at the start of the actual events on the 13th, the Russian Olympic village was empty and initial investigation found that many of the athletes had simply disappeared, while only a few had flown home. Norway has called up its reserves and ordered the IOC to cancel the games and evacuate the Olympic Village. The world is in an uproar over the loss of the Olympic spectacle and TV commentators all over the Globe are criticizing Norway‘s decision.',
  scenarios:
   '### Northern Fury Background and Scenarios\n\nThe Northern Fury scenarios follow a campaign from the initial Soviet onslaught through Norway and the North Atlantic all the way to the conclusion of the war. This campaign is the genesis of the alternate history created by Northern Fury and is the central theme running through the story.\n\nThe scenarios, fifty eight (58) in total, depict the epic struggle of a resurgent Soviet fleet attempting to strangle NATO and force a favorable situation for resolution at the bargaining table. The USSR feels, and is in fact being, strangled by the west. Their real objective is a Europe without NATO, and with the US no longer having control over potential trading partners in a region tired of a century of warfare, hot and cold.\n\nThe scope and scale of the confrontation provide little or no room for the political wrangling and double-speak we in the real world have become so accustomed to in the past 25 years. A ‘coalition of the willing‘ is generally not needed in a global war of survival. NATO‘s search for a new reason to exit is obviously no longer in question and nations respond to General Defense Plans (GDP) long practiced and still remembered by governments and militaries steeped in Cold War experience.\n\nNATO however, is caught ‘flat-footed‘ by the surprise Soviet attack, its forces are out of place, and some are out of date. Some nations realized as early as 1990 that the ‘Peace Dividend‘ was a phantom dream of the optimistic elements of society, others did not. The gradual increase in tension, proliferation of older weapons systems, political turmoil in the third world and outright hostility of the hard line Soviet regimes policies did eventually convince all that the Cold war was getting colder. By the winter of 1993/94 even the most reluctant were once again looking over their war stocks, some in horror at how quickly equipment and training succumb to the atrophy of neglect.\n\nThis is genuinely a conflict at the cusp of technological revolution. Digital warfare is in its infancy, many nations are using Viet Nam era equipment while some cutting edge technologies are making their first appearance. The play of these scenarios shows advantages and the disadvantages of these high tech systems, precise and deadly but rare and tricky to use. Juxtaposed with the mass of 60‘s era dumb bombs and dead reckoning, combining the new and the old provides the player with some very interesting results. The technology gap is not all one-sided, the USSR has invested heavily in new technology, so whether it is F-4 Phantoms going up against Su-27‘s or F-15‘s meeting MiG-21‘s the clash of layered technology gaps makes the battle challenging.\n\nWhen tackling a campaign of this magnitude it quickly becomes apparent that two things rule the flow of conflict far more than any other factor: Logistics and time. Every attempt has been made to limit both sides to the physical reality of these two factors, munitions are limited, fuel for both ships and aircraft must be provided, numbers and availability of resources are tacked. Benefit of the doubt has been granted to logistics staff of both sides who would be making super-human efforts to keep things working, but limits of speed and capacity rule some key decisions made by in the design and hoisted onto the player. I hope that this adds a context of reality and an enriched experience for the gamer who follows this story from scenario to scenario.\n\nSome of these scenarios are playable by both sides but most are NATO only, as that truly shows the desperation of the situation from the viewpoint of the defender. Although the campaign is designed to be played sequentially, this could be daunting as some of the earlier scenarios are also some of the most challenging. I recommend that you are reasonably familiar with the mechanics of COMMAND before attempting the first two scenarios, but many of the others are quite manageable to the novice player. Linkages with several other campaigns become evident through this series; Mediterranean Fury is raging but strategic decisions by NATO provide more resources for Northern Fury. Caribbean Fury is an initial distraction for the US, UK, the Netherlands and France but once the situation there appears to calm down, more assets are forthcoming. The events in Baltic Fury become a major threat to the success of this campaign, causing some critical timing decisions that the player is forced to live with. Even the far off campaigns in Indian Ocean and Pacific Fury, have an impact on the player. Eventually all of these scenarios will be available for the player to enjoy, but currently the story will have to suffice.\n\nScenarios planned for this campaign are:\n\nScenario\n\nDate\n\nTitle\n\nDescription\n\nDifficulty\n\n1\n\n13 Feb\n\n[H-Hour](scenarios.php?scenario=1)\n\nSurprise Air and Airmobile Op, North Cape\n\nHard\n\n2\n\n13 Feb\n\n[X-Ray Station](scenarios.php?scenario=2)\n\nASW sweep of NATO picket subs\n\nVery Hard\n\n3\n\n13 Feb\n\n[Dagger to the Heart](scenarios.php?scenario=3)\n\nSub attack on Civilian shipping off New York Harbour\n\nModerate\n\n4\n\n14 Feb\n\n[A Cold and Lonely Place](scenarios.php?scenario=4)\n\nQuick and dirty fight to fend off a Soviet move to seize Jan Mayen Island\n\nModerate\n\n5\n\n14 Feb\n\n[Bardufoss Blues](scenarios.php?scenario=5)\n\nAir superiority fight over Bardufoss\n\nHard\n\n6\n\n14 Feb\n\n[Trondheim Express](scenarios.php?scenario=6)\n\nSoviet Amphibious attack on Trondheim.

   '### Caribbean Fury Background and Scenarios\n\n![](assets/images/caribbean/image001.jpg)\n\nCV-67 USS John F Kennedy\n\n**Caribbean Fury Background:** The short Caribbean series represents events running parallel to the early days of Northern Fury. The Soviet Foreign Service has been actively instigating trouble in America‘s back yard. U.S. domestic difficulties and a global ‘Post-Cold War‘ malaise made western response to the evolving issues fragmented, conflicting and generally ineffective.\n\nIn Nicaragua, American withdrawal of all support to the Contra‘s after the Iran-Contra fiasco allowed the Sandinista‘s breathing space; however, when the anti-Sandinista ‘Chamorro‘ government won the election in 1990 the revolutionary movement immediately restarted, ending in a bloody coup in 92 with a Soviet leaning Sandinista Junta in control. A major funding proposal involved the planning and eventual building of a Nicaraguan Canal to compete with Panama, financing, construction and control of which would be from Moscow.\n\n![](assets/images/caribbean/image002.jpg) Although Honduras maintained a marginally effective government with significant US aid through the 80‘s, the cessation of funding and support of the Contras in Nicaragua left a power vacuum which the US-trained army could not effectively fill. By 1989 the Cinchoneros Liberation movement, now with significant Soviet backing, gained the upper hand when several Army and Air Force units turned to their cause. The televised execution of 37 American soldiers caused world outrage but was quickly eclipsed by events in Europe and elsewhere. US retaliatory cruise missile strikes at rebel targets were followed by a raft of hostage taking incidents, piracy against civilian shipping and a general withdraw of the expatriate community. The success of the widely-anticipated coup in May of 91 was a forgone conclusion, with the former President and family already living at their palatial residence near Portland Oregon.\n\nFollowing the coups in Honduras and Nicaragua, a militaristic anti-American movement gained momentum and these new governments started rearming with cast-off Algerian and Libyan equipment (as these two countries rearm themselves, mostly with Polish and former East German equipment - see Mediterranean Fury) aided by Soviet deception, training, transport and financial resources.\n\nAn attempted coup in Guatemala failed due to US clandestine activities, but there remains a solid anti-Western sentiment, including significant numbers of displaced jungle fighters who have now taken on the cause of freeing Belize of British rule. Costa Rica has remained stable as has Panama, although attempts in both countries to overthrow western supporting governments have been made, but failed miserably. The El Salvadoran Civil war rages on with both the US backed government and the FNLN precipitating atrocities which get more shocking every year.\n\n![](assets/images/caribbean/image003.jpg) Colombia has remained staunchly pro-western, and billions of US dollars ensure they remain so. The leftist guerrilla movements that started in the 60‘s, primarily FARC but others also, have gained strength but are relatively well contained. The drug cartels, however, have significant and expanding power, outspending the government on technology and now using safe havens in Honduras and Nicaragua to ease their transport risk.\n\nMexico is showing signs of emerging out of economic and political distress. It is relying heavily on the newly signed North American Free Trade Agreement and the population are expecting great things. So is the world, with the evolving revolt in the Chiapas region causing new concern! From a military standpoint, with only 12 F-5s and Gearing class destroyers, any major conflict domestic or otherwise will undoubtedly draw the US in to stabilize or protect its neighbor. Rebellion is in the wings should NAFTA fail to improve the Mexican economy.\n\nVenezuela entered a new phase in its history with Hugo Chavez seizing power during his 2nd Coup attempt in 1992 and the death of President Perez while en route to his impeachment hearings. Sitting on vast oil reserves and solidly linking itself to the new Soviet Government, Venezuela is quickly evolving as a regional power. By exerting political and financial energy and at times the threat of military involvement, neighboring countries are falling into line with Chavez‘s vision of a resurgent Caribbean trading block to control international trade into the Central and South American region. Local U.S., British, Spanish, Dutch, French and other interests have all been negatively affected.\n\n![](assets/images/caribbean/image004.jpg) US efforts in Haiti and the continuing support of the Dominican Republic continue along historical lines, as does the evolution of the Eastern Caribbean islands.\n\nCuba, as always is the most interesting of the Caribbean countries. With a resurgence of Soviet interest the Cuban military and air force in particular has been experiencing a period of revival not seen since the late 50‘s. It is suspected that most of the older SAM systems have been replaced by newer and much more capable ones, probably SA-10‘s, and that the older MiG 17‘s & 21‘s have been replaced by MiG-23‘s and 29‘s. It is rumoured that a Kilo class submarine is now on the inventory. Two weeks ago, three RORO ships unloaded under cover of darkness, heavy security and some obvious deception measures. All of this was monitored by U.S. security agencies but it is unclear what was unloaded. Indications are that it was not missiles, but probably aircraft, munitions and support equipment of various types.\n\n**Security Assessments**: The chart below should assist in understanding the status of the many Caribbean and Central American countries and their key equipment.\n\nCountry\n\nLeaning\n\nConcerns\n\nAir Force\n\nNaval Force\n\nLand Force\n\nDependency\n\nCuba\n\nSoviet\n\nAggressive\n\n12x MiG-29  \n60x MiG-23  \n48x MiG-21  \nASW, MPA, EW  \nMultiple SAM Bdes\n\n3x Koni FF  \n2x Grisha FFL  \n3 Tarantul FFL  \n18-20x OSA II FAC  \n12-15x Ptl Boats  \n2-3x Foxtrot SS  \n?1x Kilo SS?\n\n140K:  \n3 Armd Div  \n3 Mech Div  \n12 Inf Div  \n1 Arty Div  \nAbBn Bde\n\nUSSR\n\nNicaragua\n\nSoviet\n\nRe-arming\n\n24x MiG-23BN  \n24x MiG-21bis  \n12x Mirage 5D  \n12x Mirage 5DE\n\nPatrol craft\n\n80K, COIN\n\nLibya\n\nHonduras\n\nSoviet\n\nRe-arming\n\n12x MiG-23B  \n12x F-5F  \n10x A-37B\n\nPatrol craft\n\n50K, COIN\n\nUSSR\n\nVenezuela\n\nN/A\n\nIndependent\n\n23x F16 Bl 15  \n36x Mirage  \n12x F-5  \n12x AT-27  \n6x Mig-25\n\n6x Lupo FF  \n6+ patrol craft  \nSeveral Amphibious ships\n\n130K:  \n3 Inf Div  \n1 Armd Div  \n1 Jungle Div  \n1 Cavalry Div\n\nIndependent\n\nEl Salvador\n\nDivided\n\nCivil War\n\n20-30x A-37  \n12x UH-1\n\n3 patrol craft\n\n14K, COIN\n\nGovt - US  \nRebels - Cuba\n\nMexico\n\nWestern\n\nEconomic\n\n12x F-5\n\n2x Ex Gearing DD  \n2x Ex Bronstein FF\n\n70K, 7x Bdes\n\nUS\n\nHaiti\n\nWestern\n\nInsurrection Mil dissolved in 1995\n\nUtil, Tg\n\nNone\n\nInternal security\n\nUS/UN\n\nGuatemala\n\nWestern\n\nInsurgency\n\nNone\n\nPatrol craft\n\n39K, COIN\n\nUS\n\nBelize\n\nWestern\n\nInsurgency\n\nTpt/Trg\n\nNone\n\n1.5K, 3x Bn\n\nUK\n\nCosta Rica\n\nWestern\n\nInsurgency\n\nUtility\n\nNone\n\nPara Mil guard\n\nUS\n\nPanama\n\nWestern\n\nInsurgency\n\nUtility/Trg\n\nNone\n\nPara Mil guard\n\nUS\n\nColumbia\n\nWestern\n\nDrugs/insurg\n\n16x A-37  \n12x Kfir C2  \nRecon, EW, MPA, Tanker, Tpt, Trg, Util\n\n4x Padilla FFL  \n1x Dealey DE  \n2x Type 209 SS  \n2x CG Cutters  \nPatrol craft\n\n250K, 8x Div\n\nUS\n\nAruba, Bonair, Curacao (ABC)\n\nWestern\n\nProximity to Venezuela\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNetherlands\n\nTrinidad & Tobago\n\nWestern\n\nProximity to Venezuela\n\nUtil, MPA\n\nPatrol boats\n\n3K, 4 Bns\n\nUK\n\nGrenada\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPatrol boats\n\nPolice\n\nUS\n\nBarbados\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nUtil\n\nPatrol boats\n\n1K, 1 Bn\n\nUK\n\nSt Vincent & Grenadines\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nUK/US\n\nSt Lucia\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nUK/US\n\nMartinique\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nFrance\n\nDominica\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nUK/US\n\nGuadeloupe\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nDept of France\n\nMontserrat\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nBritish Overseas Territory\n\nAntigua and Barbuda\n\nWestern\n\nWorld‘s Smallest military\n\nNone\n\nPatrol boats\n\n245 in military\n\nUK\n\nAnguilla\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nBritish protectorate\n\nSt Kitts & Nevis\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nBritish protectorate\n\nSaint Maarten\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nNetherlands\n\nNetherlands Caribbean\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nNetherlands\n\nBritish Virgin Islands\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nBritish protectorate\n\nUS Virgin Islands\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nUS protectorate\n\nDominican Republic\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\n40 Util\n\n~25 Patrol boats\n\n56K, 6 Bdes\n\nUS\n\nJamaica\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\ntil, SAR, Trg\n\nPatrol boats\n\n3 Bns\n\nUK\n\nTurks & Caicos\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPolice\n\nBritish protectorate\n\nThe Bahamas\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPatrol boats\n\nPolice\n\nBritish protectorate\n\nCayman Islands\n\nWestern\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nPatrol boats\n\nPolice\n\nBritish protectorate\n\nUS forces in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico area are a mixed bag of US Air Force (USAF) Regular, National Guard, Training, Experimentation, US Coast Guard and US Navy (USN) units.\n\n![](assets/images/caribbean/image005.jpg) **USN**: In addition to ships home-ported in the Gulf and Florida, Naval Air Station (NAS) Key West, only 85 nautical miles from Havana and is the home of one the US Navy‘s advanced air combat training centers using A-4 Skyhawk‘s, F-4 Phantoms, F-16N and other aircraft in Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT). Another major facility is NAS Jacksonville, home of the P-3 community on the east coast.\n\n**USAF**: There are several major bases ringing the Gulf Coast, Tyndal and Eglin being the most active but MacDill and Patrick in central Florida also being important hubs. Since Homestead Air Force Base (AFB) was closed in 1992 due to damage from Hurricane Andrew, no permanent USAF forces have resided in south Florida. Although the base is being reconstructed and can conduct operations, it will be another year before it is ready to permanently house an air wing. Howard AFB in Panama houses a veritable museum of US counter insurgency and jungle warfare aircraft from the USAF, USMC and US Army.\n\n![](assets/images/caribbean/image006.jpg) Several NATO countries also have a presence in the Caribbean, primarily the UK in Belize, the Netherlands in their colonies, France in Martinique and Guadalupe.\n\nScenarios planned for this campaign are:\n\nScenario\n\nDate\n\nTitle\n\nDescription\n\nDifficulty\n\n1\n\n13 Feb\n\n[Hot Tamale‘s](car_scenarios.php?scenario=1)\n\nUSS Kennedy CVBG vs Cuba\n\nHard\n\n2\n\n15 Feb\n\n[Retribution!](car_scenarios.php?scenario=2)\n\nMajor operation to eliminate Cuba as a threat\n\n3\n\n17 Feb\n\n[Rumble in the](car_scenarios.php?scenario=3)\n\nJungle Counter strikes throughout Central America to eliminate opposition\n\n4\n\n19 Feb\n\n[Show of Force](car_scenarios.php?scenario=4)\n\nStrike into Venezuela to destroy a Soviet base while trying not to expand the war\n\n5\n\n15 Mar\n\n[Sucker punch](car_scenarios.php?scenario=5)\n\nVenezuela launches surprise attack to gain control of several European interests and distract the US and NATO\n\n**Scenarios created by Bart Gauvin, AKA Gunner98**',

   'The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([NATO](https://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/index.htm)) was formed on 4 April 1949, as a Military/Political body to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact (WP)countries. The basis of the alliance is the collective defence codified in [Article Five](https://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/topics_110496.htm) of the treaty which states: _"...that an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies."_\n\nThe 12 founding members of NATO are:\n\n*   Belgium,\n*   Canada,\n*   Denmark,\n*   France, (Withdrew from NATO‘s integrated military command in 1966, rejoined 1994.)\n*   Iceland,\n*   Italy,\n*   Luxembourg,\n*   the Netherlands,\n*   Norway,\n*   Portugal,\n*   the United Kingdom, and\n*   the United States.\n\nThe following countries joined NATO between its foundation and the start of Northern Fury in 1994:\n\n*   Greece (1952)\n*   Turkey (1952)\n*   West Germany (1955)\n*   Spain (1982)\n\nThe reunification of Germany in 1990, meant that the former East Germany was drawn into NATO. Between 1989 and 1994 the reunification of Germany became a major friction point between NATO and western European countries and a resurgent Soviet Union.\n\nCollectively this force - in Europe alone - amounted to over 3.7 million soldiers, sailors and airmen under arms, tens of thousands of armoured vehicles, thousands of aircraft and hundreds of ships. A formidable force. Command of this force, with 16 governments and defence ministries involved however can be complex, not to mention the scale of the geography and diversity of capabilities. At the top of the Command Structure is a political body - the North Atlantic Council (NAC) which oversaw the military element of the Alliance on behalf of the member nations. Next in line was the NATO Military Committee (NMC), which issued broad policy, interfaced with the NAC and had direct communications with each nations Ministry of Defence (or equivalent). While the NAC and NMC dealt with issues at the Strategic level, operational planning and execution of warfighting tasks was conducted by three commanders: Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) commanding all forces in Europe (Allied Command Europe); Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) commanding all forces in the Atlantic (Allied Command Atlantic); and Commander-in-Chief Allied Command Channel (CINCCHAN). The remainder of the operational portion of the NATO command structure is depicted on the chart below:\n\n![](images/nato/image001.png)\n\nOn the tactical level were dozens of Corps, Air Forces and Fleets, however clear distinction below the level depicted becomes complex because many of the commanders were ‘double hatted‘ meaning the Commander had two roles. For instance, SACLANT was also Commander US 2nd Fleet, and Commander NATO Strike Fleet Atlantic (STRIKFLEETLANT). Another example is that CINCCHAN, was not a ‘Supreme‘ Commander as the other two (SACEUR & SACLANT) but he was Commander in Chief FLEET (British Royal Navy) and Commander in Chief Eastern Atlantic Area, under SACLANT.\n\nInstead of digging into the detail of NATO‘s tactical structures, [this Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_NATO#Structure_in_1989) provides a good summary in the section ‘Structure in 1989‘.',

   'The United States Navy has been the undisputed naval powerhouse since the Second World War. Not only is it the only Navy to have global reach and power projection with multiple Supper Carriers, but its submarine fleet is arguably unrivalled, except perhaps but the USSR.\n\n![](images/USN cover_files/image001.jpg)\n\nBattle Group Z during the Persian Gulf War\n\n  \n\nHistorically 600 Ship Navy, with the warming of relations between East and West, congress started to reduce funding of new ships and demand retirement of older ships. In Northern Fury however, this warming of relations did not happen and the 600 Ship Navy remained an extant strategy, however reality and budgets do limit target aspirations. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/600-ship_Navy) gives a good summary of the original plan.\n\nThe Rational for the 600 ship Navy can be found on page 25 of this [US Congressional Report](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/99th-congress-1985-1986/reports/1985_09_futurebudgetrequirements.pdf) from Sept 1985:\n\n![](images/USN cover_files/image002.jpg)\n\nHistorically the 600 ship Navy policy was in rapid decline by the early ‘90s, but in Northern Fury it remains extant with most goals having been achieved by 1994. Some of the key areas where Northern Fury strays from the historic are:\n\n![](images/USN cover_files/image003.jpg)*   The aircraft carrier (CV) USS Ranger (CV-61) was not decommissioned but instead, held in San Diego with reduced crew and no air group as ready reserve. She will be retired when USS John C. Stennis (CGN-74) is commissioned later in 1994 or early 1995.\n*   The USS Forrestal (CV-59) was retained as an air group training carrier.\n*   USS Enterprise (CVN-65) completed an accelerated overhaul 8 months early\n*   All of the Iowa class battleships (BBs) were retained in service\n![](images/USN cover_files/image004.jpg)*   All nuclear powered guided missile cruisers (CGN) were retained. This represents a total of nine ships: 4 x Virginia class, 2 x California class, and the Long Beach, Bainbridge & Truxton.\n*   All Belknap & Leahy class CGs were retained (nine of each) with the NTU (New Threat Upgrades) complete. Combined, the additional 27 CG/CGNs means that a third CG/CGN can deploy with most Carrier Battle Groups (CVBG) as well as act as Flag for smaller Task Groups (TG).\n![](images/USN cover_files/image005.jpg)*   Four of 29 Seawolf Class fleet attack submarines (SSN) have been completed with 3-5 commissioning per year. The Virginia Class has not been designed or considered as it was built as a stop gap when the Seawolf class was canceled. Of all measures taken, this was the most controversial due to the cost of the Seawolf, and the proposals for the Virginia class are quite promising.\n*   28 Sturgeon class plus the 9 long hull (Archerfish) Class, the Narwhal and 3x Permit class SSNs were retained. The Permit‘s followed by the Sturgeons will decommission as the Seawolf class comes on line. A stable fleet size of 100 fleet attack boats and 9-10 special mission boats will be maintained.\n![](images/USN cover_files/image006.jpg)*   Seven Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers (DDG), called the DDG-51 class have been completed with 5-6 per year planned to the culminate at 62 units.\n*   Because of the urgent need for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) escorts, the shortage of dry-dock space and the increased number of Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) carrying ships; the last 7 of 31 Spruance class destroyers (DD) will not be upgraded to carry the Vertical Launch missile System (VLS) but will remain ASW DDs and undergo shorter mid-life refits than the other 24 ships. The 4 Kidd Class DDGs received their NTU in the late 80‘s and will serve another 20 years.\n*   The Farragut Class DDGs have been retained, 6x NTU refits have been completed, all based on the East Coast, with the remaining four completing later in 1994.\n![](images/USN cover_files/image007.jpg)*   Only three Charles F. Adams NTU DDGs are ready but another 12 are undergoing refit which will be completed in the next 18 months. Both of the older DDG classes (Farragut and Charles F. Adams) will serve until ~2000 when enough of the Arleigh Burke‘s are available to relieve them.\n*   The 51 unit Oliver Hazard Perry (OHP) Class Guided Missile Frigate (FFG) had completed commissioning in 89 with no replacement on the horizon. The Navy pointed out this gap to Congress and a further 12 were ordered in 91 with the first four already launched and due to commission later in 1994. As a stop-gap four Brooke Class FFG‘s (FFG-3-6) were retained, but will decommission later this year. A ‘Follow on Frigate‘ program is underway with a bid for 72 units, the first being laid down in early 95 and will replace both the OHP and the Knox Class in the escort role. The OHP will average 30 years of service when decommissioned.\n![](images/USN cover_files/image008.jpg)*   36 of the 46 ship Knox class Frigates (FF) remain in service, the remaining 10 are mothballed. The problem plagued design will be replaced by the ‘Follow on Frigate‘ program on a 2 for 1 basis starting in 1996 with most only serving 25-27 years. (Historic real life service was only 23 years).\n![](images/USN cover_files/image009.jpg)\n\nGraphically the comparison between the historic goal and the Northern Fury programme looks like this:\n\n\\>Total Other\n\nUSN Fleet size - Northern Fury Campaign vs 600 Ship Plan\n\n**Historic**\n\n**Northern Fury**\n\n1985\n\nGoal\n\nReady\n\nReserve\n\nLaunching\n\nTotal\n\nNotes\n\nCV/CVN\n\n13\n\n15\n\n13\n\n2\n\n1\n\n16\n\nCV-61 to retire when CVN-74 commissions\n\nBB\n\n2\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\nCG/CGN\n\n98\n\n137\n\n54\n\n54\n\nTotal of 124, DDG-51s coming online, older CG/CGNs to retire over time\n\nDD/DDG\n\n67\n\n3\n\n70\n\nFF/FFG\n\n108\n\n101\n\n90\n\n11\n\n4\n\n105\n\nFirst 4 of 12 new OHPs arrives, Brooks to retire\n\nSSN\n\n98\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\nSSN/Sp\n\n9\n\n9\n\nSpecial purpose, mostly SOF delivery\n\nSmall\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\n6\n\nPegasus Class FAC\n\n**Total Combat**\n\n325\n\n357\n\n337\n\n19\n\n8\n\n364\n\nAmphib\n\n62\n\n75\n\n70\n\n70\n\nMine Warfare\n\n3\n\n31\n\n30\n\n10\n\n40\n\nReplen\n\n53\n\n69\n\n58\n\n58\n\nMat Support\n\n25\n\n27\n\n26\n\n26\n\nFleet Support\n\n29\n\n33\n\n29\n\n29\n\n172\n\n235\n\n213\n\n223\n\nSSBN\n\n37\n\n36\n\n36\n\n10\n\n36\n\n**Total All**\n\n534\n\n628\n\n586\n\n29\n\n8\n\n623\n\n![](images/USN cover_files/image010.jpg)',
  US_air_force:
   'The United States Air Force (USAF) in 1994 had historically been reduced by 30% from a 1986 strength of around 608,000 to 426,000 and was shrinking rapidly. In Northern Fury, due to increased tensions in Europe and around the globe, the strength is reduced from the mid ‘80s but by a much smaller margin. The Northern Fury USAF has about 600,000 personnel in 1994 and this number has been stable for the past two years. Many of the changes implemented by the various BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure Commission) reviews (1988, 1991, 1993) do not occur, realignment where it was reasonable happened but most bases remain open, specifics are noted where it makes a difference. Structurally the changes that occurred historically remain extant because they made sense in an evolving world. The fundamental structure of the USAF looks like this:\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image001.png)\n\n**Air Combat Command**: Air Combat Command (ACC), headquartered at Langley AFB, Virginia, is the primary provider of combat air forces to reinforce regional commands around the globe or to defend North America. ACC‘s main focus is the training and preparation of combat ready fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, rescue and Battle management forces for rapid deployment or employment. This is a large command with over 230,000 regular and reserve personnel and over 1,000 aircraft.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image002.png)\n\n**Air Mobility Command**: Air Mobility Command (AMC) is another very large command which provides the USAF and the US Armed Forces as a whole with global rapid deployment options. This command is constantly busy performing air lift, air refueling, aeromedical evacuations and many other minor tasks every day of the year. With 125,000 personnel and about 925 airframes, this is the second largest command in the Air Force.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image003.png)\n\n**Pacific Air Forces**: Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) are the USAF‘s forward deployed combat and support elements in the Pacific theatre. Although relatively small with 46,000 personnel and about 330 aircraft, this still represents a significant force in the region, over 260 of the aircraft being front line combat types. One of the major tasks performed by PACAF, besides deterrence, is to train with Asian and Australian Air Forces as a way of leveraging the combat power of those nations toward a unified command system.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image004.png)\n\n**US Air Force in Europe**: US Air Force in Europe (USAFE) with its HQ at Ramstein, Germany, supplies forces to Allied Command Europe (ACE) through dedicated air wings under the control of the various NATO Air Forces. 2 and 4 Allied Tactical Air Force (ATAF) in northern Europe are both under the command of Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AIRCENT), essentially USAFE HQ under a different name. For forces allocated to southern Europe, primarily 16th US Air Force, NATO‘s 5 and 6 ATAF will control operations under the direction of Allied Air Forces Southern Europe (AIRSOUTH) located at Naples Italy.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the most significant impact of Northern Fury‘s changes occur in Europe. Historically, after ‘Peace Dividend‘ reductions, only eight Fighter Squadrons in three wings remained in Europe with about 175 front line combat aircraft. In Northern Fury, there are 12 Fighter Wings remaining in Europe, with 28 Squadrons and another 8 are on immediate recall from the Continental US (CONUS). This totals up as 860 front line aircraft and between 50 and 100 tankers, transport and reconnaissance aircraft in support. USAFE will grow well beyond this as the well-practiced flyover reinforcement program continues, swelling to more than double this number.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image005.png) ![](images/The United States Air Force/image006.png)\n\n**Air Force Special Operation Command**: Based at Hurlburt Field, Florida, the Air Force Special Operation Command (AFSOC) only became a separate command in May of 1990 when the former 23rd Air Force was re-designated to this role. AFSOC has a wide ranging list of tasks including:\n\n*   Providing combat controllers for air to ground coordination of airpower. This function is being consolidated within AFSOC from ACC, PACAF and USAFE but the capacity remains in those commands\n*   Providing Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) services worldwide\n*   Operating all airborne weather services for US Army and USAF worldwide, as well as providing aircraft to NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) which includes the US National Weather Service.\n*   Operating airborne psychological operations platforms.\n*   Operating a squadron of AC-130 Spectre gunships for close air support\n*   Operating a fleet of ‘Combat Talon‘ C-130 special mission aircraft for stealthy infiltration of special forces personnel.\n*   Operating a fleet of ‘Combat Shadow‘ C-130 special mission refueling aircraft.\n*   Operating a fleet of ‘Pave Low‘ and ‘Pave Hawk‘ helicopters for CSAR, insertion and extraction missions.\n\nAFSOC is a small, agile organization which runs its own school, test and evaluation unit and deployable Command and Control elements. Operating a fleet of over 100 special mission C-130s, 36 MH-53 heavy lift helicopters and several MH-60‘s, this force can deploy elements globally either as individual aircraft or as mission tailored groups on very short notice.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image007.png)\n\n**Air Force Space Command**: Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is another new command, it was established in 1982 to control all US military satellites, launch vehicles, space tracking and ballistic missile warning systems. The role of AFSPC increased substantially in 1993 when it inherited responsibility for all Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM) from the defunct Strategic Air Command (SAC). Additionally, the commander of AFSC is also the commander of the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), the bi-lateral command between the US and Canada for defending North American airspace from intrusion. This relatively small command has about 39,000 personnel, half of them civilian, but is located in over 80 locations around the world. Two numbered Air Forces in the command coordinate and control 580 ICBMs and over 50 communications, GPS, reconnaissance, ballistic missile warning and weather satellites.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image008.png)\n\n**Air Force Reserve**: In 1994, the Air Force Reserve (AFR) is an agency within the Air Force, it does not become a command until 1997. As an element with 80,000 personnel and nearly 500 aircraft however, the Reserve is a major component of the USAF. Many of the wings and squadrons of the AFR are ‘associated‘ with regular USAF wings and squadrons, primarily in AMC where the aircrew often share aircraft or combine regular and reserve on the same crew. Within the AFR structure there are three numbered Air Forces, 37 wings, 128 groups and about 400 squadrons (many without aircraft). There are some minor changes due to the Northern Fury setting but nothing significant. Not all detail is shown in the diagram below:\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image009.png)\n\n**Air Force National Guard**: Commonly referred to simply as the ‘Air Guard‘ or simply the ‘Guard‘ this is another large element of the USAF with over 111,000 personnel flying in 88 wings from every state of the country. The Air Guard provides trained units and people directly to the other commands. Unlike the ARS, these units belong to the State Governors until federalized for operations. Standing agreements exist for NORAD and many other domestic activities, but special permissions are needed to deploy Air Guard units overseas. No numbered Air Forces are operated by the Air Guard and many wings consist of only one squadron. Northern Fury has some significant changes that impact this element, primarily because the active air force maintains many squadrons that were historically deactivated. By 1994 the Air Guard was receiving a significant number of very new aircraft as regular units closed down, but since that does not happen, the Guard was maintaining many older aircraft until production of newer airframes could catch up to demand. The Air Guard flies over 1,500 aircraft in 109 squadrons as follows:\n\n*   7x F-15A Squadrons of 24 aircraft each, 3 are for NORAD, one is in Hawaii;\n*   29x F-16ADF Squadrons of 18 aircraft each, 14 are for NORAD;\n*   3x F-16 Block 25 Squadrons of 24 aircraft each;\n*   1x F-16 Block 50 Squadron of 24 aircraft, half of that Squadron is in the Persian Gulf;\n*   3x F-4E Squadrons of 24 aircraft each;\n*   1x F-4G ‘Wild Weasel‘ Squadron of 24 aircraft;\n*   2x RF-4C ‘Reconnaissance‘ Squadrons of 18 aircraft each;\n*   3x A7D Squadrons of 18 aircraft each;\n*   5x A-10 Squadrons of 18 aircraft each;\n*   1x EC-130E ‘Commando Solo‘ Squadron of 8 aircraft;\n*   19x C-130E/H varying between 8 and 12 aircraft each (1 Sqn is forming and has 5);\n*   2x C-141B Squadrons of 8 aircraft each;\n*   1x C-5A Squadron of 8 aircraft;\n*   1x CT-43A Squadron of 6 aircraft working with ATEC;\n*   1x C-21A Squadron with 4 aircraft for VIP transport;\n*   20x KC-135 Squadrons with 7 to 10 aircraft each;\n*   1x T-38 Squadron with around 32 aircraft working for ATEC;\n*   1x C-130E Training Squadron with 10 aircraft working for ATEC;\n*   1x F-4G/RF-4C Training Squadron with at least 12 of each working for ATEC;\n*   2x C-130P Rescue Squadrons with 5 aircraft each\n*   2x HH-60 Rescue Squadrons with 8 aircraft each\n*   1x Mixed Rescue Squadron with 4x C-130P and 6x HH-60.\n*   2x Rescue Jumper Squadrons.\n\n**Air Force Training and Education Command**: The Training Command (ATEC) is worth noting simply because of the scale at which the USAF conducts training. At any time, there are over 60,000 assigned personnel and around 350,000 students within the command. Although flight training is only one of many functions of ATEC, it operates over 1,500 aircraft in two numbers air forces, including over 350 front line aircraft!\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image010.png)\n\n**Air Force Materiel Command**: Procurement, life cycle management, testing and evaluation as well as routine logistic support is the role of the AFMC. With over 115,000 personnel and operating 40 different types of aircraft, this is a large command. AFMC also operates the ‘Test Pilot‘ school and works with industry to develop and evolve aircraft.\n\n**Northern Fury**: With the significant increase of tensions in Europe caused by the Northern Fury storyline, US lawmakers and hawks amongst the defense community watched a resurgence of hard liners with a mix of caution and anger. Increased Soviet aggressiveness as early as 1989 and then the 1991 coup that deposed Gorbachev signaled a change in the path of history. Tensions rapidly ramped up as the Soviet Union exerted pressure on Poland and Germany with the apparent goal of minimalizing NATO‘s and ultimately the United States‘ influence on Europe. As a reaction to these developments the US Government embarked on a program to rejuvenate the Reagan era programs of the 1980‘s. Three major initiatives were undertaken to stem the decline of combat power within the air force:\n\n1.  As mentioned earlier, halting the base and wing closures recommended by the various BRAC committees allowed the structure of the USAF to remain relatively unchanged, from the late ‘80s.\n2.  In order to maintain force levels, several airframes were retained in service longer than they were historically. A major impact of this was on the Air Guard, as they did not receive the windfall of new equipment in the early ‘90s. Several squadrons still fly F-4 Phantom and A-7 Corsairs, and many more retained the legacy F-16ADF (Air Defense Variant). There is a smattering of other airframes that will be retained longer than planned such as the F-4G Wild Wesel, the F-111F and B-52G, these will be mentioned in the detailed aircraft section later.\n3.  Ramping up, or more accurately, not ramping down of production. Although there are some specialty aircraft that this policy affects such as the EC/MC/AC-130 series where Northern Fury sees about 27 more airframes in use, the big impact is in front line fighter aircraft and the B-2 Bomber.\n    1.  A total of eight B-2 Spirit bombers are in service (AV-7 to AV-12, plus AV-5 & 6 held by ATEC). These have formed the 393rd Bomb Squadron at Whiteman AFB. Training, testing and evaluation is ongoing with the two ATEC airframes not ready for immediate operations.\n    2.  The F-15E Strike Eagle, all 200 ordered plus 6 replacement aircraft had been delivered by early 1992, a further order was placed for 100 airframes early enough to continue production at capacity (42/year) until 1993. Therefore, an additional three squadrons are available and the 6th Fighter Wing at Mountain Home AFB was formed. 550th Fighter Squadron, the operational conversion unit for this type is due to deactivate later in 1994, but remains extant within ATEC when Northern Fury commences.\n    3.  The single largest impact of retained production is the F-16 Falcon. Historically the late ‘80s and early ‘90s saw a massive downsizing and sell-off of this ubiquitous and versatile fighter. Many went to the Air Guard, many others went into long term preservation and yet more were sold to allies. In Northern Fury the 1988 level of production (180/year) was maintained right through 1993 and is planned to continue for at least 3 more years. Factoring in a slightly higher level of attrition, this production results in an additional 442 airframes being available, all at the Block 40/42 and 50/52 standard. Combined with retaining some older aircraft in the Air Guard, not retiring many F-16ADF, and canceling several foreign sales a net increase of 15x F-16 Squadrons are available to USAF.',
  US_army:
   'The United States Army is a large and powerful force, technologically advanced, generally well trained, and at a relatively high state of readiness. The 1980‘s was a decade of change for the US Army. Coming out of the Viet Nam era, the new professional (vice conscript) force adopted new organizations, new training methods, new equipment, new tactics and overall a completely new concept of integration of combat power. The US Army of 1994 had been tested during Operation Desert Shield/Storm in Iraq and, although there was some improvement to make, proved to a great extent that the reforms had worked beyond the imagination of most.\n\nThe US Army in Europe through the latter part of the Cold war was the focus of the entire army structure. Led by 7th Army HQ, two full Corps (V & VII) were largely stationed in Germany with a third Corps (III Corps) based in the US but having pre-positioned equipment holdings in POMCUS (Prepositioning Of Materiel Configured in Unit Sets) sites. Although problematic due to maintenance, cost, security and standardization, this system was exercised rigorously in the annual REFORGER (REturn of FORces to GERmany) [Exercises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Reforger). By 1989 the POMCUS system was set up to rapidly deploy six divisions, support elements and logistics to Germany, within 10 days, to reinforce the four divisions permanently stationed there. Historically this system came to a sudden end following the Gulf War, when VII Corps and over half of the forces in Germany were repatriated and rapidly deactivated.\n\nIn the Northern Fury world the US Army has experienced some difficulty obtaining consistent and clear government direction since the fall of the Berlin wall. The massive effort in the Gulf War was supposed to be the closing act to the Germany based VII Corps which, due to budgetary pressure to reduce spending, was due to deactivate in the early ‘90s. The increased tension from a resurgent Soviet Union has interrupted that plan mid stride - inconvenient for both military and budgetary planners. The end result is that some repatriation has occurred but some plans were canceled and others modified. The main points of impact are:\n\n*   7th US Army HQ remains in Europe (double hatted as CENTAG HQ)\n*   The 18 Division structure established by the Reagan administration remains, therefore\n    *   2nd Armored Division is not deactivated (planned for 1995)\n    *   3rd Armored Division is not deactivated (in 1992)\n    *   5th Infantry Division (Mech) is not deactivated (in 1992)\n    *   6th Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated (reduced to one Bde in 94, removed 98)\n    *   7th Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated (in 1994)\n    *   8th Infantry Division (Mech) is not deactivated (in 1992)\n    *   9th Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated (in 1991)\n    *   Additionally all National Guard and Army Reserve ‘Training‘ Divisions remain extant\n*   VII US Corps HQ remains in Europe but with a reduced staff and structure:\n    *   1st Armored Division moved to the US with 3rd Brigade remaining in Germany\n    *   3rd Infantry Division moved to the US with 3rd Brigade remaining in Germany\n    *   77nd and 210th Artillery Brigades moved to the US with a POMCUS site in Germany\n    *   7th Combat Engineer Brigade is transferred from VII Corps to 7th Army\n    *   197th Infantry Brigade (REFORGER) is transferred to 7th Army as CENTAG reserve\n    *   207th Military Intelligence Brigade is transferred to 7th Army for general support\n*   The ‘Berlin‘ Brigade is due to deactivate in July of 1994.\n*   56th Artillery Brigade, has exchanged its deactivated Pershing missile systems for M270 MLRS armed with MGM-140 ATacMS (Army Tactical Missile System) and remains a direct reporting unit to 7th Army HQ.\n*   The POMCUS program was expanded to include six more Brigade size sets of equipment; 2 for 1st Armored Division, 2 for 3rd Infantry Division, and 2 for the two artillery brigades.\n*   In order to maintain enhanced security in Kuwait, 187th Infantry Brigade Army Reserve has been activated. This is a unique structure as Battlegroup size elements from the standing army, National Guard and Reserve rotated through this Bde on an 8 month tour of duty. While in Kuwait they undergo a rigorous training program to enhance their combat capability.\n\nIt should also be noted that divisions based solely in the continental US (CONUS) except 82nd Airborne and 101st Air Assault Divisions, only had two active brigades. The third brigade was either National Guard or Army Reserve and these, although equipped the same as the active units, would take a minimum of 30 days to deploy.\n\nDuring the turmoil of the post ‘Gulf War‘ moves manning in the Army remained relatively constant. Although there was an initial dip in strength due to planned downsizing in 91-92, it has largely been made up in 93. The strength as of Jan 1994 is slightly smaller than its recent peak in the late ‘80s but about 200,000 more than historic - totals of the US Army is:\n\n*   Army: 755,000\n*   Army National Guard: 450,000\n*   Army Reserve: 582,000\n\n**Structure**: Within the continental US (CONUS) there are six army level HQs (1st Army to 6th Army), these are primarily tasked a mobilization role in times of national crisis. They can be activated for operations such as 3rd Army in the Gulf war. The two active armies, 7th Army in Europe and 8th Army in Korea are on full operational status. Within CONUS all active duty units are assigned to Corps and most have a wartime deployment role. The Corps in CONUS are:\n\n![](images/United States Army/image001.jpg) **I Corps**: This is a small Corps charged with experimentation and development, but also has emergency deployment tasks. It is likely that I Corp would deploy to US Army Pacific, probably with 7th Infantry Division (ID), along with its artillery, aviation and air defence brigades. 9th ID is a very unique formation; it is the testbed light wheeled vehicles and rapid ground mobility. This division was earmarked to deploy to Northern Germany or Denmark, however its lightly armored infantry ((HMMWV or Desert Patrol Vehicles), combined with only having two tanks battalions (in its National Guard round-out brigade) may have precluded its employment on that front. Its high speed cross country mobility, on the other hand made the unit ideal for desert operations.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image002.png)\n\n**III Corps**: The complete opposite of I Corps, this corps is a massive organization which is destined for Europe in its entirety. An initial glance at the organization is misleading however. III Corps, in addition to its own formations, is a holding organization for 7th Army in Europe. Divisions tasked with rapidly reinforcing both Europe based Corps through REFORGER are held under command of III Corps for training and administration while in CONUS, their parent Corps have operational command however. III Corps will deploy to northern Germany and operate as part of NORTHAG (British Army on the Rhine) while formations supporting V & VII Corps will be under command of CENTAG (7th US Army).\n\n![](images/United States Army/image003.png)\n\nIt is worth noting that the POMCUS policy was to move 6, now 8 divisions to Germany in less than 10 days: 1st Cav, 1st ID, 1st AD, 2nd AD, 3rd ID, 4th ID, 5th ID, 194th Armd Bde\\*, 197th Inf Bde\\*, 3 ACR, 212th FA Bde plus two more FA Bdes for Northern Fury. The last division (unless you count the three independent Bdes as a division) is 9th ID from I Corps, which would fly over in its entirety. The feasibility of all but the 9th ID deployment was well practiced, as discussed earlier, 9th ID was not well suited to the north German plain. (\\*From XVIII Airborne Corps below)\n\n**XVIII Airborne Corps**: Commonly referred to as ‘America‘s Contingency Corps‘ this organization has seen a lot of recent action and deployed to the Sini peninsula in 1982, Grenada in 1983, Panama in 1989 and the Gulf war in 1991. Similar to III Corps above, this formation is also charged with holding elements destined for Europe, but the main elements of the corps are its three rapid deployment divisions, each one unique. 82nd Airborne Division has a battalion task force on 24 hours notice to move anywhere on the globe, at all times, and the remainder of a brigade moving within 3 days. The 101st Air Assault Division maintains an aviation brigade with over 320 helicopters; more than most nations operate. 10th Mountain Division is capable of moving by air to anywhere in the world within 10 days. 10th Mountain has a National Guard round-out brigade but both of the other divisions are fully manned standing army units.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image004.png)\n\n**US Army Europe**: Commanded by 7th Army HQ, also acting as NATO CENTAG, these two Corps and supporting units have been the focal point of US Army training and development since the end of the Korean War. After the post-Gulf War reductions this force is at its lowest point in terms of manning since 1950, with only two fully manned divisions, six independent or forward positioned brigades and two armored cavalry regiments. Given 10 days to mobilize, 7th Army or CENTAG would be a powerful force indeed, with 10 American, 7 German, 3 French and one Canadian division at its disposal. Ten days is a long time in a modern conflict however.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image005.png)\n\n**US Army Pacific**: US Army Pacific is a diverse and dispersed organization. Commanded by Commander 8th Army with his HQ in South Korea and having forces in Alaska, Hawaii and Japan, this army relies very heavily on its allies and the USAF to add armor and firepower to the fight.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image006.png)\n\n**US Army South**: The 193rd Infantry Brigade is the only regular army unit in this command. The primary purpose of this brigade is security of the Panama Canal Zone, but it also assists the Panamanian Government and other US agencies in conducting counter insurgency and counter narcotics operations.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image007.png)\n\n**US Army Kuwait**: In the three years following the Gulf War, tensions in the region have increased, primarily because Iran has become increasingly hostile towards the West and Iraq. In all likelihood this resurgent hostility is linked to improved Iranian relations with the Soviet Union. Therefore, in order to maintain enhanced security in Kuwait, the 187th Infantry Brigade, Army Reserve has been activated. The brigade is a shining example of the ‘Total Force‘ concept within the US Army, the HQ, an infantry battalion, 5-5th Artillery Battalion HQ and one battery, Engineer Company and Cavalry Troop are from the Army Reserve. The regular army and the National Guard provide a battalion and an artillery battery each to the force. Each battalion rotates in for an 8-month tour of duty and mans in-place equipment, conducts an intensive training program and then returns home. The battalions rotate at 4 month intervals and routinely train with Kuwaiti and Saudi forces.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image008.png)\n\n**US Army Special Operations Command**: The US Army Special Operations Command (USA SOC) is a relatively new organization, formed in 1989 when all Special Forces were place under the control of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). This force, trains, equips, maintains and deploys Special Forces elements worldwide. Combined with US Navy and US Air Force Special Operations elements operating under the control of SOCOM, it can precipitate strategic effect with a comparatively minor force commitment.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image009.png)\n\n**US Army Reserve**: The Army Reserve is a force of 582,000 personnel, 1/3rd of the total strength of the army. Although the vast majority are ‘part time‘ soldiers, they are well trained and equipped, subject to immediate recall and many have regular army experience. Part of the reserve structure are the 10 ‘Training Division‘ HQs, their primary function is to be a focus for mobilization, training and equipping mobilized troops, and perhaps commanding those troops as a follow on formation, or providing replacements for battle losses. Another factor to consider when examining the diagram below, logistics units are not included, and a large portion of the Army Reserve are logistics units.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image010.png)\n\n**The US Army National Guard**: The National Guard (NG) represents 25% of the deployable army and is a fundamental element in the ability of the US Army to succeed in battle. Over 60,000 National Guardsmen deployed to the Gulf War including two formed artillery brigades. The Gulf War also pointed out some shortcomings in NG readiness and a program has been put in place to rectify these. Some units are equipped with the latest generation of equipment while most use slightly older kit, but even that is the same or better than some NATO allies. Four of the NG division HQs, as well as the IX Corps HQ, at least one artillery brigade and probably several other elements have a follow on reinforcement role to NATO. Readiness levels have improved since the Gulf War as have training programs. Most units should be ready to deploy within 30-45 days of mobilization while some will take up to 60 days of training with some re-equipping. It is likely that more than 50,000 NG troops will deploy individually or in small units within the first 14 days of mobilization including up to five artillery brigades, two engineer brigades and one or two aviation brigades.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image011.png)\n\n### Equipment\n\n**Main Battle Tank (MBT)**\n\n**[M1](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m1.htm)**: The extremely successful M1 Abrams MBT began production in 1979 and continued through 1985 when the last of 3,273 were produced for the US Army. This is a 61 ton tanks with a 105mm rifled gun, it can travel at 45 MPH (72 KPH) and has a range of 310 miles (500 Km). This is an excellent, reliable, well proven tank, it has the same gun as the Leopard 1, but is 50% heavier and has a shorter range. The main concern with this MBT is high fuel usage requiring additional logistic support. After sales to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, upgrades to later variants and general attrition are factored in; there are 1630 basic M1s available to the US Army in 1994.\n\n**M1IP**: This version has improved engine performance, efficiency, and better turret armor but in most other ways is the same as the M1. There were 894 produced in 1984.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image012.jpg) **M1A1**: This tank, in addition to other improvements, replaced the gun with the 120mm Smooth bore cannon, the same gun that is on the Leopard 2. In comparison the M1A1 is heavier but achieves the same speed (42 MPH/68 KPH) over a longer distance 288 miles (463 Km) versus the Leopard 2 which achieves a range of 211 miles (340 Km). By 1992 there were 4,976 M1A1s produced.\n\n**M1A2**: Although 190 were produced by 1994, there were about 1000 M1s upgraded to a similar configuration as the M1A1 in particular upgrading the gun. They also had a second thermal site for the commander allowing rapid engagement subsequent targets at night or in obscured conditions. Total available in early 1994 is 1,190.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image013.jpg) **[M60A3](http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/M60_Patton.php)**: Built in the 1980s, the latest version of the ‘Patton‘ MBT carried the same British made L7, 105mm riffled gun as the M1 Abrams, with a fire control system that produced a 70% hit probability of another tank at 2000 meters. By the time production stopped over 1700 of these tanks had been built and another 1700 older models had been converted to this standard.\n\n**Disposition of MBTs**: As the M1A2 Abrams continues to be produced, an ongoing program is cascading newer MBTs across the entire army. Formations assigned to REFORGER have a higher requirement as they need to provide a fill set of equipment to the POMCUS site, while maintaining a partial set for training in CONUS. Formation assigned to 7th Army Europe, both permanently stationed and REFORGER units require approximately 5,300 MBTs, 1,800 of which will cascade to NG units upon mobilization. Other active army users such as I Corps, 24th ID and PACOM require another 500 MBTs. All of these units are also equipped with the M1A1 or M1A2 Abrams MBTs. Army Reserve elements, NG independent armored battalions and brigades as well as the armored battalions in independent infantry brigades and armored cavalry regiments are equipped with the M1IP. The remaining formations are a mix of basic M1 MBTs and M60A3s.\n\n**Armored support vehicles**: All armored support vehicles are based on the M60 chassis. Although some support vehicles based on the M1 are in development, they are several years from fielding. These are spread throughout the force:\n\n*   312 x M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle (CEV)\n*   400 x M60 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB)\n*   1,427 x M88A1 Armored Recovery Vehicles (ARV)\n*   896 x M88 upgraded to A1 standard\n\n![](images/United States Army/image014.jpg) **[M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV)](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m2.htm)**: The Bradley is the standard infantry vehicle in the mechanized forces of the US Army. It is armed with a 25mm ‘Bushmaster‘ chain gun, has a crew of three and carries six soldiers able to dismount to clear the enemy. By 1994 initial production was complete and upgrading older versions to meet the latest standard was underway, this is several months faster then happened historically. In total 4,641 M2s were built with over half being built to the A2 ‘high survivability‘ standard. All but the first 1,600 A0 variants also carried a TOW 2 missile launch system. M2 disposition is roughly equivalent to the M1A2 laydown, with Germany based units and POMCUS sites having the latest A2 variants and CONUS based units, Reserve or NG having the A0.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image015.jpg) **[M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV)](http://www.military-today.com/apc/m3_bradley.htm)**: Almost identical to the M2 in appearance, the M3 only carries two dismounts, with the remainder of the space used for extra radios, storage and ammunition for the TOW missile systems. In all, 2,083 CFVs were built and issued to all armored cavalry units, including NG units. These had the same variant details as the M2 and once again, Germany has the latest equipment while the older variants requiring refit are in CONUS.\n\n**[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) Family](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m113.htm)**: This versatile and reliable family of vehicles has been in use for over 30 years in the US Army and has found its way into over 50 other armies around the world. Some 34,000, primarily the standard ‘Battlefield Taxi‘ variant were produced for the US, while over 80,000 were produced worldwide. These vehicles are used in virtually every mechanized unit in the army and are often pushed into roles they were not designed for. In 1994 the following are in the inventory:\n\n*   Approximately 16,000 x A1, A2 or A3 variant standard troop carrier.\n*   1,600 x M113A4 Armored Medical Evacuation Vehicle (AMEV)\n*   1950 x M106 mortar carriers with 107mm (4.2in) mortars.\n*   1275 x M125 mortar carriers with 81mm mortars.\n*   4000+ x M548 ammunition carrier.\n*   5000+ x M577 command post vehicle.\n*   3300 x M901 Self Propelled (SP) TOW-2 missile launchers.\n*   1000+ x M981 Fire Support Team Vehicle (FIST V)\n*   600 x M730A2 Guided Missile Equipment Carrier (Chaparral)\n\n![](images/United States Army/image016.jpg)\n\n**Artillery**: The US Army has vast quantities of artillery systems to outfit the 48 artillery brigades across the force. Each division has a DivArty Bde generally consisting of a 155mm battalion with 18 guns working as Close Support each maneuver brigade, plus a battery of MLRS (M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System) and a target acquisition battery in General Support. 82nd and 101st divisions have 105mm Close Support battalions and a 155mm General Support Battalion. The 30 independent brigades have a wide range of configurations and are meant to provide the Corps and Army commanders flexibility by supporting the main effort divisions with extra fire power.

   'Great Britain‘s Royal Navy, with over 450 years of history is the UK‘s Senior Service. Over it‘s history it has fought both against and along side most other navies in NATO. Although by 1994, after three decades of budgetary constrictions, the RN is still a potent force but only a shadow of its former self. Maintaining a full suite of naval capabilities from strategic ballistic missile submarines, through aircraft carriers, an active amphibious force and global logistics, the RN is stretched thin and is some areas only held together by tradition and pride.\n\n![](images/uk royal navy/uk_royal1.jpg)\n\nThe recent war experience in the Falklands gave British politicians and budget conscious bureaucrats a lesson in the cost of neglect. Thus with the increased tension in Europe, the Navy has managed to convince government to infuse it with much needed capital in the form of new build and retained ships. Unfortunately, not much of the new build production has reached the fleet, but readiness is high and capabilities have been moderately improved.\n\nGlobal commitments to support the vestiges of a colonial empire have the RN deployed in every corner of the planet, you are likely to see British ships in all campaigns portrayed in Northern Fury.',
  UK:
   'The UK is one of the founding members of NATO and is arguably the second most important military power behind the US. Arguably because Germany, Turkey and Italy, not to mention France have become increasingly important while the UK military forces have shrunk considerably since the formation of the Alliance. For a better understanding of the entities that make up the UK, you may wish to watch this humorous but accurate [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNu8XDBSn10). In 1994 the British military was about 250,000 strong, but technologically advanced and proficient and very well trained.\n\nTerritorial commitments, disputes and agreements are too numerous to mention but the UK has global commitments which it struggles to maintain with its reduced military force. However, despite the difficulties since 1982 the British forces have fought and won in the Falklands, the Gulf War, Yugoslavia and Bosnia, along with a continuing commitment to Northern Ireland, Belize, Brunei, Hong Kong, Kenya, Cyprus and Gibraltar.\n\n![](images/United Kingdom Cover_files/image002.jpg)',
  UK_british_army:
   '**British Army**: The British Army is a large and diverse organization with long standing traditions and global commitments. One of the key components is the ‘British Army on the Rhine‘ which commanded all British troops on continental Europe during peacetime and took on the responsibilities of NORTHAG HQ in wartime (Northern Army Group). More detail can be found at this link. In all likelihood at least one French Corps would come under command NORTAG as well.\n\n![](images/british army/image001.png)\n\nIn addition to the BAOR the British Army had significant forces stationed at home. Some of these troops were tasked with reinforcing BAOR while others had Home Defence tasks, and responsibility for security in Northern Ireland. Upon mobilization it was expected that units moving to Germany would arrive and be ready for combat within 72 hours, this was tested on several major exercises and was well planned and rehearsed. The ‘TA‘ (Territorial Army) elements are the equivalent of National Guard, Militia or Reserve forces. 30 Engineer Bde provided general support engineering to NORTHAG, 1st Infantry Bde reinforced HQ Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany while 5th Airborne Bde became a general reserve unit for tasking by SHAPE. If the AMF(L) (ACE\\[Allied Command Europe\\] Mobile Force -Land) deployed to Norway the British Battle Group would accompany it, if not this unit would reinforce BAOR. Home defence units, in addition to security, would form a recruiting and training base for replacements into BAOR.\n\n![](images/british army/image002.png)\n\nAnother key role for the British Army is maintenance of overseas garrisons. Each one is unique and has evolved into its current form through diplomatic commitments, changes to the local threat and availability of forces. The Falklands garrison was only a 45 man Royal Marine platoon when Argentina invaded; the reinforced Battalion Group currently residing there is much more of a deterrent. Training is also a key factor in these overseas garrisons and units tasked to deploy on a rotation, do so with the intent of achieving significant training while stationed abroad. To facilitate this there are established training units in each garrison as well as Kenya and Canada where units deploy specifically for training opportunities.\n\n![](images/british army/image003.png)\n\nFinally elements that are not strictly within the Army but which occupy the land environment and therefore share some training and equipment similarities with the Army are shown below. The RAF Regt is primarily dedicated to airfield and nuclear storage site security. The Royal Marine Commando Bde is a unit of the Royal Navy (RN) and able to deploy globally but routinely trains, with an attached Dutch Battalion, for deployment to Norway. The SAS (Special Air Service), along with the SBS (Special Boat Service) controlled by the RN are the UK‘s globally deployable Special Forces element.\n\n![](images/british army/image004.png)\n\n##### Main Battle Tank (MBT)\n\n![](images/british army/image005.png) **Challenger 2**: Historically this tank was not integrated into the British Army until 1998, but the first tanks were produced in 1994, three years after being ordered, followed by a further three years of trials and testing. Northern Fury has the first 70 already produced, enough to equip one Tank Regt (Bn) in BAOR. The Challenger 2 marks a significant improvement in MBT capability for the British Army, it has a 120mm rifled gun as opposed to the smooth bore on the Leopard 2, AMX Leclerc or M1A1 or A2 Abrams, allowing the use of HESH (High Explosive Squash Head) ammunition for supporting infantry and ‘bunker busting‘. As far as protection, the Challenger 2 with its improved Chobham armour is, in 1994, probably the most heavily protected tank in the world, others tanks with add on armor improvements, would soon catch up.\n\n![](images/british army/image006.jpg) **Challenger 1**: The British Army operated 420 versions of this tank which had a 120mm gun, the original form of Chobham armour and reasonable mobility. Its direct competitor for this generation of tank - the Leopard 1, was faster, and more agile - but less protected and only had a 105mm gun.\n\n![](images/british army/image007.jpg) **Chieftain**: Although old, this 1960‘s era tank was cutting edge when produced and was regularly upgraded. It carried the same 120mm rifled gun as the Challengers but its armour was of welded steel construction and therefore much less capable than the composite Chobham armour of its successors. 870 Chieftains, plus a large number of bridge-layers, recovery vehicles and engineering vehicles were still in service in 1994. Over 400 were in storage and available for use, as were 570 of the older Centurion tanks.\n\n##### Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV)/Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC)\n\n![](images/british army/image008.jpg) **Warrior IFV**: Initially delivered in 1988, the full order of 1053 was filled in the Northern Fury world (vice the historic reduction to 789) with the last examples coming off the assembly line in the spring of 1994. Representing a quantum leap in capability over the FV-432 series of APC, the Warrior added a 30mm cannon to the firepower of an infantry section, and significantly improved protection and mobility as well. Several command, observation and repair vehicles were also produced.\n\n![](images/british army/image009.jpg) **FV-432**: The FV-432 is the British answer to the American M113 APC, the basic version can carry 10 soldiers in addition to the 2 man crew. Built in several variants this is a versatile and adaptable vehicle but generally underpowered. Early production examples, the Mk1 was produced with a gasoline engine (petrol), most of these have since been replaced by a two stroke multi-fuel engine, still underpowered but more sustainable within the NATO supply system. Over 2400 are in service throughout the British Army.\n\n![](images/british army/image010.jpg) **CVR-T: Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)**: This is a prolific family of vehicles conducting all manner of tasks within the British Army. Seven main variants are in use in 1994:\n\n*   Scorpion: Reconnaissance vehicle with 76mm gun, 313 in use, 184 with the RAF Regt;\n*   Striker: Anti-Tank variant with a Swingfire missile system, 89 in use;\n*   Spartan: APC with a 3 man crew and 4 passengers, 691 in use;\n*   Samaritan: Ambulance variant, 50 in use;\n*   Sultan: Command and control vehicle, 291 in use;\n*   Samson: Armoured Recovery Vehicle (ARV), 136 in use;\n*   Scimitar: Reconnaissance vehicle with a 30mm cannon, 334 in service;\n\n![](images/british army/image011.jpg) **Saxon**: Essentially an armoured 4-wheel drive truck, this ‘battle taxi‘ is able to deliver a section of troops in relative protection but with limited off road mobility. 527 of them are in service.\n\n![](images/british army/image012.jpg) **Saracen**: Another ‘battle taxi‘, this 6-wheeled APC introduced in the mid 50‘s had several variants. Only about 300 of them are left in service in 1994.\n\n![](images/british army/image013.jpg) **Artillery**: The Royal Artillery fielded some 42 units in the British Army including air defence. The M109‘s were historically sold to Austria in late 1994 however that deal was not offered in this storyline, instead the 155mm Close Support Regts in maneuver Bdes were equipped to war strength of 24 guns each, leaving two Regts of Abbots in that role, the rest of the Abbots were put in reserve. The Light Guns support of the light role Bdes, the Pack howitzers support the Airborne, and the remainder are for General Support to Divisions and 1 BR Corps. The MLRS arrived for service in 1992.\n\n*   200x Abbot 105mm Self Propelled (SP) Howitzers (in reserve);\n*   212x 105mm Towed Light Guns (Howitzers)\n*   51x M-56 Pack Howitzers\n*   145x M109A2 155mm SP Howitzers (not sold to Austria in 1994);\n*   179x AS-90 155mm SP Howitzers (all delivered by spring 1994);\n*   72x FH-70 155mm Towed Howitzers\n*   37x M107 175mm SP Howitzers;\n*   16x M110 203mm SP Howitzers;\n*   24x MLRS systems\n\n**Air Defence**: Also operated by the Royal Artillery (RA) with the exception of the Rapier SAMs operated by the RAF Regt\n\n*   50x Rapier SP\n*   72x Rapier Towed operated by the RA\n*   72x Rapier Towed operated by the RAF Regt\n*   Blowpipe and Javelin MANPADS',

   'Belgium maintained a powerful Air Force in the later Cold War era, however, they were quick to try and cash in on the ‘Peace Dividend‘ when the Berlin Wall fell and most thought that the Cold war was ending. Luckily, the coup in Moscow reversed the trend in Brussels and although several squadrons were on the verge of standing down, they were kept, initially at a lower state of readiness but as tension with a resurgent Soviet Union heightened in 91/92, training increased and new weapons were purchased. The Belgian Air Force was committed to 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force (2 ATAF) on the Central front over Germany.\n\n![](images/belgian air force/belgianAir1.jpg) **F-16**: Belgium and the Netherlands formed a production consortium to build F-16s in Europe, eventually producing over 500 of them primarily for Norway, Denmark and themselves.

They were not meant for service outside of Canada, but there was no effective plan to re-equip the force in times of emergency and they deployed to Bosnia, Croatia, Somalia and Africa on various missions - so they would undoubtedly be deployed to Europe in Northern Fury.\n\n![](images/canada army/canada_army3.jpg) ![](images/canada army/canada_army4.jpg)\n\n**M109** - Canada operated 76 M109A4B+ howitzers, with 24 equipping 1st Regiment Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA) in Germany and two regiments of 18 guns each in Canada supporting the other two Bdes of the Division.\n\n![](images/canada army/canada_army5.jpg)',

   '**French Air Force (Armée de l‘air or Air Army)** - The French Air Force is one of the largest in Europe with 93,000 personnel and over 70000 reserves. Maintaining over 450 combat aircraft, a strategic and a tactical nuclear capability and significant support and transport elements, the French Air Force is critical to the defence of Europe. The Air Force is divided into four major commands: Strategic Air Force (CoFAS) operating IRBMs (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles), bombers and refueling aircraft; Tactical Air Force (FATac) operates most of the strike aircraft; Aid Defense Command (CAFDA) operating Fighter Interceptors; and Air Transport Command (CoTAM) operating transport and helicopter squadrons.

The role of this group is to conduct both conventional and nuclear strike missions in a high threat environment. Thus, not only strike aircraft are required, but reconnaissance, and electronic warfare as well.\n\n![](images/france air force/image010.jpg)**Mirage F1CR** - A reconnaissance version of the baseline interceptor, this aircraft has a secondary ground attack role. 64 were built and they equipped three squadrons of the 33rd wing at Strasbourg.\n\n**Mirage F1CT** - Yet another version of the Mirage F1, 55 of the CT or strike variants were converted from the F1C-200‘s in 91-92. Historically they replaced a Jaguar wing but in Northern Fury they formed a new wing, the 6th which also took on the role of providing the contingent in Djibouti. These aircraft look identical to the reconnaissance version.\n\n![](images/france air force/image013.jpg)**Mirage 5F** - This aircraft, a derivative of the Mirage III was meant for export, in particular to Israel. Do to political tension over the 1967 Arab/Israeli war, France embargoed the sale of these aircraft. Although Israel had paid for the jets, and several attempts to obtain them were made, the 50 aircraft were eventually adopted into the Armée de l‘air as the Mirage 5F. They were designed for the clear weather ground attack role and were operated by the 13th wing at Colmar.\n\n**Mirage 2000N** - This is two seat version of the basic fighter and is designed specifically for tactical nuclear weapon delivery. Its wings are strengthened for low level flight, an electronic countermeasures suite, and it has a precision navigation system with terrain avoidance radar. 75 of this version were produced and operated by four squadrons of the 4th wing at Luxeuil\n\n![](images/france air force/image015.jpg)**Mirage 2000D** - This is the multi-role, two seat version of the basic Air Superiority design and very similar to the 2000N. This aircraft is designed for delivering conventional munitions and has been modernized from the 2000N with improved radar and a digital cockpit. Historically it entered service in 1994/95 but in Northern Fury it arrives three years earlier and 72 of a planned 96 have been built. Both wings equipped with this aircraft are housed at Nancy, the 3rd was historically the first wing converted and also a new wing, the 20th forming to allow yet another Jaguar wing to be retained.\n\n![](images/france air force/image016.jpg)**SEPECAT Jaguar** - Unique in the Armée de l‘air‘s fighter aircraft, the Jaguar was not produced by Dessault! SEPECAT is a consortium of Breguet and British Aircraft Corporation (now BAE Systems).

   'Although France is not part of the NATO military alliance, its forces are earmarked to reinforce NATO, and although they are not integrated as other NATO counties, there is an understanding of commitment. I Northern Fury, France Declares itself a full NATO partner within hours of the war starting and the Armed Forces of France come under the NATO military command structure.\n\nThe French Army is large, 296,000 active and over 400,000 reserve soldiers. It is however, organized quite differently from most NATO nations. Brigade HQs have been removed and units report directly to the Division HQ, also most divisions are about half the strength of their NATO counterparts and the ‘Light Armoured‘ Divisions are about the size of a typical NATO Brigade. 1st French Army is assigned to deploy to Germany as part of CENTAG (Central Army Group) while the Force d‘Action Rapide will deploy to NORTHAG (Northern Army Group). In addition to these deployable forces, there are six Territorial Defence Regions with assigned troops, the Gendarmerie (para military police force), the French Foreign Legion (mostly in central and northern Africa) and forces overseas in former colonies throughout Africa, Djbouti, Reunion Islands, the French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Caribbean and supporting Coalition operations in the Persian Gulf.\n\n![](images/france army/image002.png)\n\n  \n\n![](images/france army/image004.jpg) **Leclerc**: The French Army was in the initial stages of re-equipping its forces with this new Main Battle Tank (MBT) when Northern Fury occurs. This tank with very modern fire control, advanced armour and a 120mm gun was easily the equivalent of the M1A2 or the Leopard 2 in many respects, probably superior in some areas, and certainly a match for anything the Soviet forces had available at the time. Production commenced in 1992, with the first unit equipped by the end of 1993. Within 2e Régiment de Chasseurs, part of 10th Armoured Division is equipped with 80 of these new tanks, while further production continues at an increased pace.\n\n**AMX 30**: The standard MBT of the French Army, 1,355 of the original AMX 30 were accepted into service and in the 80‘s and early 90‘s the final 271 production tanks and 820 conversions ![](images/france army/image006.jpg)(as originally planned and more than historic) were to the AMX 30 B2 standard with an improved fire control system, a better engine. The non-stabilized 105mm gun puts this in an equivalent class to the American M60A1 or the Soviet T-62 - a good tank but not in the same league as the latest NATO or WP competitors. Many variants were produced, including an Air Defence version with Roland missiles, a Self Propelled Gun, engineering variants and even 44 ‘Pluton‘ tactical nuclear missile launchers.\n\n![](images/france army/image008.jpg) **Armoured Cars**: The French Army had various armoured cars for divers usage, mostly in the Light Armoured Divisions and reconnaissance roles. Over 425 AML-60 remained in service from an original procurement of over 3000, although there were several hundred in reserve. These are used in a reconnaissance role in most divisions and in the Foreign Legion but also provided the basis of a complete family of vehicles with many variations. The French Gendarmerie also use over one hundred examples of this vehicle.\n\n![](images/france army/image010.jpg) One of the more prolific variants of the AML was the AML-90 with a 90mm low velocity gun (short recoil). The Army uses 210 of these variants in the Light Armoured Divisions, reconnaissance units and for specialized units in other divisions. The Gendarmerie and Foreign Legion also uses this type.\n\n![](images/france army/image012.jpg) A more modern vehicle was needed to replace the AML-90 and in the early 80‘s the ERC-90 was produced. Also with a 90mm gun but this was a smooth-bore cannon which allowed the firing of improved Armour-Piercing, Fin-Stabilized, discarding Sabot (APFSDS) ammunition. This improvement enabled a much better capacity to destroy older type Soviet tanks and other armoured vehicles out to a range of 2000 meters. Only 192 of these armoured cars entered service with the Marines, Airborne and Alpine divisions.\n\n![](images/france army/image014.jpg) A more effective vehicle to support light forces is found in the AMX-10RC, which is a heavier 6-wheeled armoured car with a 105mm medium velocity gun. 284 of these vehicles can be round in the tank destroyer and reconnaissance roles in light armoured divisions, mechanized divisions, 9th Marine division and the Foreign Legion. The very capable gun is designed to be fired from light vehicles such as this and with specialized ammunition can penetrated the side of a Soviet MBT at 2000 meters. The hydropneumatic suspension is adaptive and allows for both high speeds and a low profile when needed.\n\n![](images/france army/image016.jpg) **Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC)**: Like most French vehicles, their APCs were all French designed and built, with a mind for the export market. Also these vehicles were only the base and spawned many variations. The tracked APC (AMX-10P) had 15 different variants fielded while the wheeled APC (VAB) developed a staggering 35 variants from a riot control vehicle to Milan and HOT ATGM (Anti-Tank Guided Missile) launcher. All examples of these two vehicle families had NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection and were amphibious.\n\nThe tracked AMX-10P was used primarily in the mechanized infantry units of the heavy armoured divisions and their supporting artillery observers. Over 1500 of the base model with a 20mm autocannon were delivered as well as ambulance, recovery, ATGM, artillery observer, radar, mortar and mortar tractors, command, and cargo variants.\n\nThe wheeled counterpart to the AMX-10 is the VAB (Véhicule de l‘Avant Blindé or Vanguard Armoured Vehicle). This was the most numerous APC in the French Army by a long margin with over 4000 in the inventory and over 1000 more produced for export. These are built in both a 4-wheel and 6-wheel configuration but the vast majority in French service are the 4-wheeled variety. This vehicle is amphibious, lightly armoured and armed and extremely versatile. Every division has at least one unit equipped with the VAB and dozens of variants are in use throughout the force.\n\n![](images/france army/image020.jpg)\n\nVAB firing a HOT Anti-Tank Guided Missile.\n\n  \n\n![](images/france army/image022.jpg) **Artillery**: The French produce GCT was a 155mm howitzer built on an AMX 30 chassis. The gun provided NBC protection, and auto-loader enabling a rate of fire of 6-8 rounds per minute out to a range of 23,500 meters. Using rocket assisted projectiles the range increased to 28,000 meters. By 1994, 253 GCTs were in service, replacing most of the old and unprotected Mk3 guns produced in the 50‘s.\n\nNumerous older 155mm and 105mm artillery systems were in use in various roles within the French army.',
  france:
   'Although France left the NATO military command structure in 1966, it was one of the 12 founding members. In Northern Fury, France rejoins NATO within 7 hours of the war starting.\n\nThe significant military inventory fielded by France is hindered in several ways: The near 30 year absence from NATO means that interoperability with other nations has suffered; France‘s defence industry had fallen behind technologically in some areas leading to long development times (Rafale took 25 years from contract to fielding), excessive build times (12 years for the Aircraft Carrier Charles De Gaulle), nether of which are available for Northern Fury; Limited sales within NATO but significant sales to potential enemies (Dassault Mirage type fighters, Exocet SSMs, Crotale SAMs etc); Several unique but dated doctrinal anomalies remain within the French structure, (Light Armoured Divisions etc).',
  germany:
   'Although Germany reunified in 1990, all is not celebrations and roses in the Northern Fury world. With the Soviet Union in resurgence, economic pressures in Germany and a political movement to leave NATO has caused significant instability in Berlin and throughout northern and eastern Germany in particular. Strong internal movements in Bavaria have been a counter to the left wing movements in the north causing further disunity.\n\nMilitarily, unification did little to boost Germany‘s capabilities. Most of the ships were sold off or simply scrapped. Germany retained seven patrol boats, an icebreaker, survey ship and several smaller craft. A list of the actual transfers can be found here. The air force of the former East Germany held some 1000 aircraft, all but a single squadron of 22 MiG-29‘s were sold off or scrapped within six months of reunification. The Bundeswehr was reduced to 370,000 personnel. This was Germany‘s contribution to the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe. As a result, the Bundeswehr was significantly reduced, and the former East German National Volksarmee (NVA) was disbanded.',

   '**German Army (Deutsches Heer)**: The current form of the German Army was founded on 12 November 1955, when West Germany joined the NATO alliance and reformed the military branch of government (Bundeswehr). By 1985 the army was at its established strength of 12 Divisions. The diagram below depicts the peacetime organizational structure. However, in wartime 3rd Panzer Division (I Corps) would transfer to the 1st Netherlands Corps, while 26 & 27 Fallschirmjäger Brigades would join 1st Fallschirmjäger Division and become SHAPE reserve.\n\nThe **Schleswig-Holstein Territorial Command (SH)** in wartime would take charge of several home defence Brigades and Regiments and operate as a Division or possibly Corps level HQ under **Allied Command Baltic Approaches (BALTAP)**. 6th Panzergrenadier Division would also come under command BALTAP and, depending on the situation, operate independently or under the command of **SH**.\n\n![](images/german army/image001.png)\n\nThe pre-unification army had a strength of approximately 340,000 regulars and 717,000 reserves and territorial defence forces. The regular forces could deploy to their wartime (GDP - General Defence Plan) positions within 24 hours and full mobilization of reserves and territorials would happen within 3-4 days.\n\nAfter unification the Heer merged with the Nationale Volksarmee of the former East Germany, forming a IV Corps headquartered in Potsdam, starting in 1990. Between 1990 and 1994 this fourth Corps was reduced in size until it was replaced in the Berlin/Potsdam area by III Corps. Very little former East German equipment was held, most of it was sold to finance unification. Since the bulk of both armies were conscripts, reduction of the total strength was simply a management issue. Historically however, over this time the structure and size of the Heer changed significantly between 1993 and 1996 - these changes did not happen.\n\n![](images/german army/image002.png)\n\nLeopard II\n\n**Leopard II**: Considered by many to be the finest tank in the world with a 120mm L44 smoothbore gun, a speed of 68 KPH, an operational range of 550Km with internal fuel and excellent armor protection. This tank is at least on par with the British Challenger 2, French Leclerc or the American Abrams. By 1994 the full production run of 2,125 was complete, and retained by the Heer. None of the engineering variants of the Leopard 2 had reached production but the Armored recovery vehicle variant was starting to arrive in units by 1994. Leopard I specialist variants were used instead.\n\n![](images/german army/image004.jpg)\n\nLeopard I\n\n**Leopard I**: The Leopard I was used widely throughout Europe and Canada as well. The German Army operated a total of 2,437 of them. With the introduction of the Leopard II, some were put into storage but most replaced M48s in reserve units. 1,225 tanks were upgraded to the ultimate ‘A5‘ standard, while 250 were ‘A4‘ versions, 110 were ‘A3‘, 232 were ‘A2‘ and the remainder were upgraded to the improved Leopard 1 A1A1 standard. In addition to the original production were large numbers of specialist vehicles such as:\n\n*   377x Gepard Anti-Aircraft variants;\n*   105x Biber Bridge Layers;\n*   444x Bergepanzer 2 Armored Recovery Vehicles (ARV);\n*   36x Bergepanzer 2A1 ARV for engineer vehicles;\n*   140x Badger Engineering vehicles;\n\n![](images/german army/image005.jpg)\n\nGepard\n\n![](images/german army/image006.jpg)\n\nBiber Bridge Layer\n\n![](images/german army/image007.jpg)\n\nBergepanzer ARV\n\n![](images/german army/image008.jpg)\n\nBadger\n\n![](images/german army/image009.png)\n\n**Luchs Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle**: The German Army used 408 of these 8-wheeled amphibious vehicles in their reconnaissance battalions. With 8-wheel drive and all wheel steering, being equipped with thermal sites, a 20mm cannon and long range radios, it was ideal for the job it was tasked for.\n\n![](images/german army/image010.jpg)\n\n**Marder IFV**: Germany was the first NATO country to adopt the IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) concept with the Marder. 2,133 of these vehicles were used in Panzergrenadiere units. In addition to the 20mm Cannon and the Milan ATGM (Anti Tank Guided Missile), the soldiers in the passenger compartment can engage targets from inside the vehicle or quickly dismount and assault. The Marder can carry 12 infantrymen but normally carried a crew of 3 with 7 dismountable soldiers as passengers.\n\n![](images/german army/image011.jpg)\n\n**M113 Family**: More than 4,000 of the ubiquitous M113, in addition to thousands used as infantry carriers‘ numerous variants are found in the German Army, including:\n\n*   +220x M577 Command Post;\n*   +500x Panzermorser 120 - 120mm Self Propelled Mortar;\n*   154x Artillery Fire Control variants;\n*   320x Beobachtungs Panzer Artillery observation vehicles;\n*   301x M548G Skorpion Minenwerfer, mobile mine dispenser;\n*   Forward Air Controller variant;\n*   Electronic Direction Finding variant;\n*   Signals vehicle;\n*   Ambulances;\n*   Radar carriers;\n*   Artillery locating Radar carrier;\n\n![](images/german army/image012.jpg)\n\n**Fuchs Series**: The Fuchs is a Six-wheeled Armored Personnel Carrier (APC). The German Heer operated 1,040 of these vehicles in several variants. The basic vehicle was an amphibious and designed to carry a crew of 2 with 10 passengers. Variants include:\n\n*   550x Standard Fuchs 1;\n*   87x Non amphibious versions with larger payload;\n*   265x fitted with various mission kits;\n*   140x NBC reconnaissance vehicles;\n\n![](images/german army/image014.jpg)\n\nJaguar 1\n\n**Tank Destroyers**: Three types of tank destroyers were used by the German Army. The idea was that these had the firepower of a tank but neither the maneuverability nor the protection. By 1994 they didn‘t have the firepower either.\n\n*   607x Kanonenjagdpanzer, with a 90mm gun;\n*   162x Jaguar 2, a Kanonenjagdpanzer with the gun replaced by a TOW2 ATGM\n*   316x Jaguar 1, a similar chassis with a HOT ATGM\n\n![](images/german army/image015.jpg)\n\nJaguar 2\n\n![](images/german army/image016.jpg)\n\nKanonenjagdpanzer',

   'The modern Luftwaffe, although named the same as its forbearers of World War Two does not draw any continuity earlier than 1956. Although struggling after unification and some internal strife, the Germans retain over 500 front line combat aircraft. Some like the modernized F-4 ICE are nearing the end of their lifespan but with the troubled Eurofighter program not yet producing a replacement, the Tornado is carrying a heavy load in the Luftwaffe. Organizationally air units were grouped in wings, geschwader or Marineflieger with two squadrons (staffel) each.\n\nUpon reunification of Germany in 1990 a significant reorganization took place. Most of the aircraft of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR, or East Germany) were passes to Czechoslovakia to hole, in an agreement with the Soviet Union - pending final disposition. Since then over 250 MiG 21‘s, 65 MiG-23‘s, 50 Su-22‘s, 50 L-39‘s, almost 200 helicopters and over 250 SAM systems have found their way into other militaries mostly in Africa but also in South and Central America. The key exception was the two dozen modern MiG-29s which the GDR received only a year before the collapse of its government, these have been fully integrated into the Luftwaffe and have been used extensively by the US and other NATO nations for training. The German MiG pilots are probably the best in the world after four years of force on force training against the finest air forces in the alliance.\n\n![](images/germany air force/image001.jpg) **MiG-29**: The Soviet build MiG-29‘s are the most modern aircraft in the German inventory. They are highly maneuverable multi-role aircraft which have done outstanding service conducting DACT (Dissimilar Air Combat Training) with many NATO nations. Used as aggressors on almost every major NATO exercise since 1990, the pilots of Jagdgeschwader 73 (Fighter Wing 73) became extremely adept at air to air combat. All 24 of these aircraft, including 4 twin seat training variants were maintained in the 1st Squadron 73 JG (1/73 JG)\n\n**Panavia Tornado**: The Tornado is a result of a Tri-national (British, German and Italian) effort to replace aging, ![](images/germany air force/image002.jpg)primarily American aircraft in the 80‘s and early 90‘s. This was a highly successful effort with almost 1000 aircraft produced in three variants. The Luftwaffe procured 160 Tornado IDS (Interdiction/Strike) and 34 Tornado ECR (Electronic Combat/Reconnaissance), while the German Navy (Bundesmarine) acquired 112 IDS variants which will be included here. No Air Defence Variants (ADV) were purchased by Germany who were banking on the Eurofighter Typhoon for the air superiority role. That aircraft was yet to make its first flight (March 1994). The intention was that the IDS version would replace all Alpha Jets an F-4F Phantoms in the Fighter Bomber, however due to increased tensions one wing of Phantoms was retained and two wings of Alpha Jets were kept in front line service. Fighter bomber wings are named Jagdbombergeschwader (JBG)\n\nThe Bundesmarine maintains two wings (Marineflieger or MFG) of 48 aircraft each, specializing in the marine role with AS.34 Kormoran Anti-ship missiles.\n\nThe Operational Conversion Unit for this type is maintained in the US at Holloman AFB.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\n1/31 JBG\n\nBoelcke\n\nNorvenich\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n2/31 JBG\n\nBoelcke\n\nNorvenich\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/32 JBG\n\nTiger\n\nLechfeld\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n2/32 JBG\n\nTiger\n\nLechfeld\n\n14\n\nTornado ECR\n\n1/33 JBG\n\nHawk\n\nBuchel\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n2/33 JBG\n\nHawk\n\nBuchel\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/34 JBG\n\nAllgäu\n\nMemmingen\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/34 JBG\n\nAllgäu\n\nMemmingen\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/38 JBG\n\nFriesland\n\nJever\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n2/38 JBG\n\nFriesland\n\nJever\n\n16\n\nTornado ECR\n\n1/39 JBG\n\nErding\n\n12\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/MFG 1\n\nSea Hawks\n\nNordholtz\n\n24\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/MFG 1\n\nSea Hawks\n\nNordholtz\n\n24\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/MFG 2\n\nEggebek\n\n24\n\nTornado IDS\n\n2/MFG 2\n\nEggebek\n\n24\n\nTornado IDS\n\n![](images/germany air force/image003.jpg) **Alpha Jet**: Primarily an advanced jet trainer, the Luftwaffe chose to us this aircraft in the light attack role to replace the Fiat G91. Although used as a weapons training platform in Beja Portugal, most advanced training for the Luftwaffe was conducted in the US using American facilities and aircraft. In 1993 an agreement with Portugal for the continued use of Beja included passing 50 Alpha Jets to that country, this deal was kept but further sales of Alpha Jets were cancel and two wings were maintained in front line service.\n\nSqn\n\nLocation\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\n1/49 JBG\n\nFürstenfeldbruck\n\n18\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n2/49 JBG\n\nFürstenfeldbruck\n\n18\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n1/43 JBG\n\nOldenburg\n\n18\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n2/43 JBG\n\nOldenburg\n\n18\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n1/44 JBG\n\nBeja Portugal\n\n18\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n![](images/germany air force/image004.jpg) **F-4 Phantom**: Germany used the F-4 extensively from 1971 onwards, originally operating 175 F-4F‘s and 88 RF-4E‘s operationally and several F-4E‘s for training in the US. In order to fill the critical Air-to-Air shortfall in the Luftwaffe while the Eurofighter was being developed the venerable F-4F underwent a modernization program - ICE, meaning Improved Combat Efficiency. The two most significant improvements were the addition of the modern APG-65 radar and the ability to fire AIM-120 AMRAAM BVR (Beyond Visual Range) missiles. 110 conversions were authorized and by the start of Northern Fury 80 had been completed, slightly quicker than historic where 70 had been converted by the end of 94. The major drawback however was the lack of the AIM-120 missile, Germany only ordered 96 for delivery in 2005, leaving the Phantoms to use AIM-7 Sparrows and AIM-9L Sidewinders. Two and a half wings of the ICE were in operations (JG 73 operating one Staffel of MiG-29 and one of F-4 ICE) while three other wings were using the un-modified F-4F‘s.\n\nThe other key role of the Phantom was that of reconnaissance. Two full wings of RF-4E were relied on to provide intelligence and BDA (Bomb Damage Assessment) using photo, Infrared and SLAR (Side Looking Airborne Radar).

   '**Norwegian Army**: The Norwegian Army is small, only 19,000 permanent force and much of that was a conscript force, but with a ready reserve of 146,000 and regular mobilization training, the ability to rapidly expand to a potent force was credible. Northern Fury has the Norwegian Army progressing slowly towards the goals of the 1974 Defence Commission proposal. Also with the Olympics ongoing and the increased tension, some units were at a higher state of readiness and several reserve battalions were fully mobilized. Because of the focus on Norway in the Northern Fury Storyline, more detail is provided here than for other countries.\n\n**Brigade Nord**: This is a very unique organization stationed in the Bardufoss area of northern Norway. Each of the three combat arms battalions in Brigade Nord is task tailored for well-practiced and specific tasks, but they are also designed for maximum flexibility and rapid changes of the situation.\n\n**1st Panzer Bn**: Although named as a Panzer or ‘tank‘ battalion, this unit is actually a homogeneous mix of infantry and armor. Designed to provide a counter moves force to the ground commander, it can just as easily block restricted terrain using its tanks as mobile bunkers. The Leopard 1 however is meant for rapid movement and this is how the unit was designed, allow the less mobile infantry and home guard units to slow an advancing enemy while the Panzers attack them where they are vulnerable.\n\n**2nd Mech Bn**: This large battalion is a cross between the traditional Norwegian battalions (Type 78) and the evolving Type 90 that was called for in the defence review. Although the unit now has four instead of three rifle companies, only two are mechanized while the others remain mounted in BV206 over-snow vehicles. Supporting elements within the battalion are all M113 base variants including mortar carriers, TOW anti-armor vehicles, the pioneer/engineer platoon and the reconnaissance squadron.\n\n**Telemark Bn**: This unit, established in 1993 and historically evolved to be a mechanized deployable unit for peace support and COIN operations. In its original design however, as the name suggests, was much different. This unit was meant to become a highly skilled mountain infantry unit, counterbalancing the more heavily mechanized 2nd Battalion. Eventually it will receive some improved BV206 variants for deploying mortars and TOW anti-tank missiles. Currently in Northern Fury, the unit gains mobility by using snowmobiles and skis in the winter, light trucks and motorcycles in the summer.\n\n![](images/norway army/image001.png)\n\nThe remainder of the Norwegian Army is much more traditionally organized, but due to its unique geography, small population base and rugged terrain, each organization has its differences. Starting in the North and moving South these formations are:\n\n**6th Division Finmark**: A mix of Permanent Force, Reserves and Fortress units, the HQ is also located in Bardufoss. Brigade Nord, responds to national priorities and does not belong to this formation but trains with it regularly. In the early moments of Northern the 105mm artillery battery features prominently as does the East Finmark Battalion (Östre Finnmark Defense Bn).\n\n![](images/norway army/image002.png)\n\n**4th Division Trondheim**: Although 12 & 13 Brigades are a mix between Permanent Force and Reserve, they have been mobilized to provide security for the Olympics in Lillehammer. 12 Brigade is a good example of a ‘Type 90‘ Brigade with an armoured battalion and two infantry battalions, each with four companies.\n\n![](images/norway army/image004.png)\n\n**V Brigade (Brigade West) Bergan**: Another permanent force brigade, part way to the ‘Type 90‘ standard, ‘V‘ Brigade would likely form the nucleus of a division in wartime.\n\n![](images/norway army/image003.png)\n\n**1st Division South**: This formation has the largest concentration of units in the Army. Brigade Sud (South) represents the Permanent Force element while four reserve brigades and 14 independent garrisons round out the structure. In all likelihood these forces would form two divisions in wartime. Most of the trade schools are also located in this area.\n\n![](images/norway army/image005.png)\n\n**2nd Division Oslo**: Finally the Oslo area has another concentration of units. The Kings Guard is a mix between Reserve and Permanent Force but is mobilized for ceremonial duties during the Olympics.\n\n![](images/norway army/image007.png)\n\n![](images/norway army/image006.jpg) **Leopard 1**: Like many other nations, Norway decided to purchase the Leopard 1 Main Battle Tank (MBT). A total of 172 MBTs were acquired in addition to several specialist vehicles; 14 Armored Recovery Vehicles (ARV), 9 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB) and 22 Armored Engineering Vehicles (AEV).\n\n![](images/norway army/image008.png) **M48A5 Patton**: Norway first acquired the M48 Patton in the 1963 when 38 of them were obtained, these were upgraded in the mid 80‘s to the M48A5 standard with a 105mm gun. Also in 1986 an additional 17 were purchased and used as an independent squadron in the Oslo area. The original tanks were retired 1993 when the last of the Leopard 1‘s were put into service but they remain in reserve.\n\n![](images/norway army/image009.png) **NM-116 Super Chaffee**: 72 M24 Chaffee light tanks were upgraded between 1973 and 1977 and deployed as ‘Tank Destroyers‘ with a low velocity 90mm D-925 gun from France, and many other improvements. Attached to the Anti Tank units in Infantry Brigades it could fire High Explosive (HE), Smoke, and High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) rounds. The HEAT was used to kill tanks and light armored vehicles while the smoke and HE provided excellent support to infantry units. Although retired in 1994, they remain in service for Northern Fury.\n\n![](images/norway army/image010.png) **NM-135**: This is a modified M113 APC, it has a 20mm autocannon, smoke dischargers and is used as an early and inexpensive Infantry Combat Vehicle (ICV). Some 100 of these vehicles were produced by modifying existing M113‘s but in Northern Fury the total is increased to ~140. This would imply a corresponding reduction of the ~300 M113‘s available but these are easily replaced if required.\n\n![](images/norway army/image011.jpg) **BV206**: The Norwegian Army uses over 1000 of these versatile light vehicles. Used primarily as an infantry section vehicle, modifications have been made to carry mortars and TOW anti-tank missiles, as well as command variant and several other tasks. The video at this link demonstrates the all terrain maneuverability.\n\n![](images/norway army/image012.jpg) **NM-142**: These are M113 vehicles with an early TOW under armor system very similar to the US M901. Norway had 100 of these variants and they worked very closely with the NM-116 in the Anti-Tank companies of Infantry Brigades.\n\n**Artillery**: The Norwegian Army had several artillery systems:\n\n*   Hundreds of 81mm Mortars\n*   97x M-30F1 107mm Mortars\n*   28 M106A1 107mm Self Propelled (SP) Mortars\n*   220x M101 105mm Howitzers\n*   126x M109A3GN 155mm SP Howitzers\n*   48x M114/39 155mm towed Howitzers (39 calibre barrel)\n*   ~100x M114/23 155mm towed Howitzers (23 calibre barrel) in reserve\n\n**Air Defense Systems**: Several different Air Defense systems were in use. The RBS-70 was very modern and in the Permanent Force units.\n\n*   108x RBS-70 SAMs\n*   132x M1 40mm AA guns\n*   Numerous Bofors 40L60 and 40L70 AA guns\n*   20mm KK-202 towed AA guns\n*   12.7mm Quad towed MGs\n\n**Cessna O-1A Bird Dog Spotter Aircraft**: Very few militaries still used fixed wing spotter aircraft in 1994 but the Norwegian maintained 17 venerable Cessna Bird Dogs for artillery spotting.\n\n![](images/norway army/image013.jpg)',

   '**Norwegian Air Force**: The Norwegian Air Force manages all air activity for the Army, Navy, Coast Guard as well as conducting traditional Air Force tasks.

Deployed in four Squadrons each conducts patrols in North Norway on a rotational bases and regularly deploy to dispersal bases throughout the country. A unique feature of Norwegian F-16s is the ability to fire the AGM-119 Penguin 3 missile, an anti-ship armament critical due to the long and exposed coastline and vulnerability from the sea. Historically the first MLU (Mid life Upgrade) aircraft, able to fire the Aim-120 Air to Air missile arrived in 1995, however, that has been advanced by a year in Northern Fury and 338 Squadron has four of the improved aircraft on its roster.\n\nAt the start of Northern Fury, 331 Sqn from Bodo is forward based at Bardufoss with 4 additional ‘B‘ model aircraft, elements of 4 aircraft are dispersed in to Banak, Tromso and Evenes and they are maintaining a 24/7 Combat Air Patrol out of Bardufoss.\n\nAs the photo indicates, encounters with Soviet MiGs in northern Norway were not uncommon.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\nRemarks\n\n331\n\nLion\n\nBodo\n\n16\n\nF-16A/B\n\n+4 F-16B\n\n332\n\nEagle\n\nRegge\n\n16\n\nF-16A/B\n\n334\n\nCola\n\nBodo\n\n16\n\nF-16A/B\n\n338\n\nTiger\n\nOrland\n\n12\n\nF-16A/B\n\n\\+ 4 MLU\n\n![](images/norway air force/image002.jpg) **F-5 Tiger II**: Although Norway was in the process of retiring the F-5 Freedom Fighter, increased tensions changed that plan. Historically by 1994 the only F-5s remaining were 718 Sqn at the Fighter training school (14x F5B), 717 Reconnaissance Sqn (16x RF-5A) and 336 Sqn with 24x F-5A focusing on ground attack.

These were civilian pattern Dassaut Falcon executive jets that were heavily modified and sold to several air forces as a stop-gap area EW platform. The programme was quite successful.\n\n![](images/norway air force/image004.jpg) **P-3C & P-3N Orion**: These Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) were operated by No. 333 ‘Hawks‘ Sqn out of Andoya. The four P-3C‘s were standard Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) versions while the two P-3N were modified to operate for the Coast Guard and were unable to carry weapons, did not have a Magnetic Anomaly Detector or Sonobuoys and was only able to conduct area surveillance and other non-military missions.\n\n![](images/norway air force/image005.jpg) **C-130 Hercules**: No. 335 Sqn flying out of Gardermoen air base operated six C-130H Hercules conducting routine transport tasks for all branches of the service including the Coast Guard.\n\n![](images/norway air force/image006.jpg) **Sea King**: Operated for the Coast Guard the Mk43B Sea Kings are primarily for SAR and air ambulance missions but can also be use for maritime patrol and utility tasks. No. 330 ‘Viking‘ Sqn operates these 12 aircraft and they are dispersed in groups of two or three throughout Norway as required by the Coast Guard.\n\n![](images/norway air force/image007.jpg) **Lynx**: Operated by No.337 Sqn primarily from Bardufoss but operating from various bases, these six Mk86 Lynx are meant for SAR and patrol work only.

   'Norway is one of the 12 original members of the NATO alliance and was initially the only one to share a boarder directly with the Soviet Union. Turkey has shared that distinction since it joined in 1952. With a population hovering around 5 million people and having a long and vulnerable coastline, Norway is dependent on NATO‘s collective defence assurances for its survival. Even though a small country economically, Norway routinely spent over 3% of its GDP on defence, 50% more than NATO required.\n\nNATO realized the critical vulnerability of its northern flank and made provision for rapid deployment to Norway. AMF (ACE \\[Allied Command Europe\\] Mobile Force) deployment and pre-positioned equipment was exercised annually. STANAVFORLANT (Standing Allied Naval Force Atlantic) was also routinely deployed to Norwegian waters. Routine training by British Royal Marines and US Marine Corps units on Norwegian territory familiarized many involved with the intricacies of fighting on Norway‘s rugged terrain. Finally, NATO E-3A AWACs aircraft were continually stationed in Norway at Orland Air base\n\nNorway‘s military is small but highly trained and well equipped to utilize the advantage of terrain to counteract its disadvantage of geography.',

   'The Portuguese Air Force is in transition. After several decades focusing on Colonial issues, primarily in Africa, the Força Aérea Portuguesa are struggling to dispose of older 1950‘s based aircraft and become more modern. World tension however is making that difficult. Without a domestic aircraft industry to speak of, Portugal is at the mercy of suppliers. Because it allows the US to use the key base at Lajes on the Azores Portugal is now, after significant diplomatic effort, being compensated and is in the process of receiving their first Squadron of F-16‘s from the US, against the wishes of the USAF which is working hard to use every F-16 available.

   '**Portuguese Navy** - The Portuguese Navy (_Marinha de Guerra Portuguesa_) traces its history back to the 12th Century through colonial exploration to the modern day. Unfortunately, most of Portugal‘s ships lightly armed and designed for overseas duties in a low threat environment, although they were effective in exerting influence in former colonies they are rather anemic by European and North Atlantic standards.

   'The Portuguese army is a small conscript force which maintains key functions at high readiness and maintains basic skill sets for rapid mobilization. Structurally they have a Corps HQ, but in reality this formation would function at the Divisional level and either remain in Portugal to enable mobilization or deploy with the Mechanized Brigade to NATO‘s Southern Army Group (SOUTHAG). The standing army was 44,000 personnel with about 175,000 reserves. ![](images/Portuguese Army_files/image001.png)\n\nThe majority of the Portuguese Army is ‘light‘. The units are either specialized light infantry such as the Paratroop Brigade which is controlled by the Air Force, the Marines which are controlled by the Navy or the Commandos who are tasked by the national HQ, or lightly equipped regional forces. The one mechanized formation ‘1a Brigada Mista Independiente‘ or 1st Mixed Brigade has an armored battalion (M60A3 TTS), a mechanized battalion (M-113) and a motorized battalion (trucks). The garrison units are unique; they are based on a light infantry battalion but have a battery of 105mm artillery, a reconnaissance squadron and air defence.\n\n![](images/Portuguese Army_files/image002.jpg) **[M60A3 TTS Main Battle Tank (MBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M60_Patton#Variants)**: The US provided Portugal with 93 M60A3 TTS as well as several bridge layer, engineering, recovery and driver training variants in 1991. These replaced M-48s which were returned to the US. These are standard M60A3 with a Thermal imaging targeting site added to improve night and poor visibility operations.

  portugal:
   'One of the 12 founding members of NATO, Portugal with a population of 10 million and a low GDP was also the poorest by most measurements. Ultra-ideological policies, a transition from colonialism to socialism and then finally to a liberal democracy, all leaving the economy in a state of turmoil requiring the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to step in with stabilization programs in the 70‘s and again in the 80‘s. After joining the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1986, the economy improved substantially.\n\nThe troubled political and economic situation did not leave much room for military growth. Although one of the smaller militaries in NATO, Portugal maintains several key bases, critical for security of trans- Atlantic commerce, particularly Lejas in the Azors but also the Cape Verde Islands and Madeira. Germany also uses the Portuguese base of Baja for its air combat training, and the HQ for Commander - in- Chief Iberian Atlantic (CINCIBERLANT) is located just west of Lisbon at Oeiras.',

   '**Spanish Army**: With a strength of 201,000 and 142,000 ready reserves, the Spanish Army was quite a large force but somewhat under equipped in comparison to other armies in NATO. Most formations were designed to be light, with only 300 tanks that could be considered modern in 1994 (AMX-30). Structurally Spain would provide a Corps HQ organized either as a mechanized or a mountain formation to reinforce the land fight in southern Europe, probably Turkey or Greece. There were no forward deployed forces. Divisions were comprised of two brigades, each having two regiments and in turn these had two battalions; slightly smaller than a standard division (8 battalions vice 9) but very heavy on the command element. There are also a number of independent brigades of various types.\n\nA good summary of the Spanish Army in 1989 is located [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Spanish_Army_in_1989), very little changed between ‘89 and ‘94 when Northern Fury commences.\n\n![](images/spain army/image001.png) ![](images/spain army/image002.png)\n\nIn addition to the field army there were elements of supporting forces and also territorial defence forces for Spanish colonies.\n\n![](images/spain army/image003.png)\n\n![](images/spain army/image004.jpg) **Main Battle Tanks (MBT)**: Spain had quite a mix of mostly obsolete MBTs, concentrated in 1st and 3rd Division, there were some older MBTs in 2nd Division as well.\n\n**AMX-30**: Spain built most of its 299 AMX-30E (E for Spanish) under licence from France. They also purchased 10 AMX-30D recovery vehicles and 18 AMX-30R carrying the Roland SAM system. The AMX-30 could be considered on par with the Leopard I, and Spain considered that tank but opted for the AMX when France offered to produce it in Spain. All of the Spanish AMX‘s had been upgraded to the ‘M2‘ standard with an improved fire control system, improved engine and drive train as well as many other improvements. Historically only half of the AMX‘s were improved while the remainder received a cheaper and more problematic upgrade, in Northern Fury all were upgraded to ‘M2‘ standard. The Tank is used extensively in the 1st Armored Division and also within the mechanized brigades of 3rd Division.\n\n![](images/spain army/image005.jpg) **M60A3**: Between 1990 and 1993, the United States provided Spain with 244 M60A3 Patton MBTs to replace their aging fleet of M47 and M48 tanks (also provided by the US). These tanks were used in the 2nd Division, the Cavalry Regt of 3rd Division and the two independent Cavalry regiments. Although more reliable and updated than the M48, these tanks were still obsolete.\n\n![](images/spain army/image006.png)**M47/M48**: By 1994 these tanks had been retired from Spanish service; however they were still quite numerous and had only been retired in the previous couple years, so were available:\n\n*   162x M48A5E2\n*   329x M47E1\n*   46x M47E2\n\n**Reconnaissance Vehicles**\n\n**AML 60/90**: Spain used ~100 of each type in their reconnaissance units.\n\n![](images/spain army/image007.jpg)**BMR-VEC**: This is a Spanish built, six-wheel reconnaissance vehicle equipped with a 25mm chain gun. There were 240 of the six-wheeled version built and 100 four-wheeled variants which have since been retired.\n\n**Armored Personnel Carriers (APC)**: In addition to over 1,200 of the ubiquitous M113, the Spanish had another ‘home grown‘ solution.

The basic troop carrying version has a crew of two and can carry eight or nine infantrymen and mounts a .50 Calibre MG. There are several variants including mortar carrier, recovery vehicle, ambulance, engineering and anti-tank, and command. Spain has over 1000 of these vehicles including variants.\n\n![](images/spain army/image009.jpg)**Artillery**: Spain employed a wide variety of artillery systems, it was in the process up upgrading its M107 (175mm Self Propelled) Howitzers to the M110 (203mm).

   'Spain was the last country to join NATO once the countries democratic restoration gained enough momentum, following the Dictator Franco‘s death in 1975, to hold a national referendum on the subject. Although strongly opposed by a strong socialist opposition, which came into government that year, the plebiscite voted for joined NATO.\n\nSpain‘s fractious relationship with the United Kingdom over Gibraltar, Portugal over the Savage Islands and the town of Olivenza on the border between the two countries. Other NATO countries have deep seated issues over Spain‘s fascist history requiring significant work to overcome during its integration with the military alliance. Close relations with the US and France however, counterbalanced these issues, the major US fleet base at Rota Spain and air facilities in the Canary Islands ensure continued US support.\n\nOther territorial disputes with Morocco have a minor impact on the Spanish Military, in particular Perejil Island in the Strait of Gibraltar, several other small islands and the Spanish held territories of Ceuta and Melilla.\n\n![](images/spain/image001.jpg)',

   'The Netherlands Army was mainly deployed in a Corps organization. The three Dutch mechanized infantry divisions were organized along streamlined Brigade Group structures without divisional troops. The corps troops organizations, particularly artillery and engineer were quite extensive which allowed for very flexible grouping based on the mission assigned. Although each mechanized division has a Panzer Brigade, and the other two Brigades in each division has a Panzer Battalion, the armored punch of the corps comes from the attached German Panzer division. ![](images/netherlands army/image001.png)\n\nThe other key element of the Netherlands ground forces are the Netherlands Marines. This is a unique organization which does not normally operate as a unit, but in separately tasked battalion sized ‘Groups‘. ![](images/netherlands army/image002.png)\n\nBoth the 1st Group and the Parachute Company would normally be assigned to work with the British 3rd Commando Bde. These troops were trained for mountain and arctic warfare and would routinely train to deploy in Northern Norway.\n\nThe 2nd Group was dispersed throughout Dutch colonies in the Caribbean and West Indies, primarily providing local security but also able to form into a strike force if necessary.\n\nThe 3rd Group were reservists, formerly enrolled as marines this unit would initially provide security at naval bases but then would develop several Marine Battalions or a Marine Regiment for deployment.\n\n**Leopard 2**: The Dutch are the second largest operator of the Leopard 2, with 445 of them in the inventory. Starting in 1993, many (eventually 330) were upgraded to the Leopard 2A5 standard with improved armor. Representing about half of the tanks in service, the 4th Division was equipped entirely with the Leopard 2 while the Panzer Bde in the 5th Division also had these tanks. ![](images/netherlands army/image003.jpg)\n\n![](images/netherlands army/image004.jpg)\n\nLeopard I\n\n**Leopard 1**: The other half of the operational tanks in the Netherland‘s roster were Leopard 1V‘s, the ‘V‘ standard had a better fire control system then the original tank. The 468 Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) were used primarily in the 1st Division and the Panzerinfantrie Brigades of the 5th Division. Also many of the Leopard 1 variants were used by the Dutch, including the Bridglayer, and the Armored Recovery Vehicles (ARV).\n\n**Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV)**: Although there were about 500 M113‘s and up to 900 YP-408‘s (an 8-wheeled Dutch design from the 50‘s) in the Netherlands Army, the most important IFV was the YPR-765. Although they were derived from the M113, the basic version of YPR-765 was equipped with a 25mm cannon and firing ports so infantry inside the vehicle could fire their weapons. 2079 of these vehicles were used but that includes several command variants, 119 Anti Tank variants (PRAT) with TOW missiles and other specialist vehicles. All of the regular army Panzerinfantrie units were equipped with this vehicle.\n\n![](images/netherlands army/image005.jpg)\n\n**Lynx (M113C&V)**: For reconnaissance work the Dutch use the M113 based Lynx vehicle but have added a 25mm Oerlikon turret. There are 250 of these in service amongst the Reconnaissance battalions in each division and at corps level.\n\n**Artillery**: The Netherlands Corps had extensive artillery firepower including an artillery battalion of 20 M109‘s (Self Propelled (SP) 155mm howitzers) in each of the nine brigades and a Corps Artillery Group of Division size.\n\nWithin the Corp Artillery organization were three ‘Groups‘ of Brigade size: 101st with two batteries of Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), 22 launchers and a battalion of Lance Missiles, 6 launchers. The other two ‘Groups‘ were General Support (GS) tubed artillery units: The 102nd had five battalions of M110 SP 203mm (8") howitzers and a battalion of M109s; the 104th Group (Reserve) had five battalions of towed 155mm guns, the M114/39.\n\nIn total the inventory included:\n\n*   22 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS);\n*   6 MGM-52 Lance; (not retired)\n*   76 M110A2 203 mm SP howitzers;\n*   222 M109 155 mm self-propelled howitzers (A2 & A3 variants);\n*   123 M114 155 mm towed howitzers.\n\n**Note**: Historically only 82 of the M114‘s had been upgraded to the 39 Caliber barrel. but in Northern Fury all 123 were and in addition to the 4th battery added to each battalion in 104th Group, two of the retired (in 1990) battalions were retained. In addition, the Lance missiles (retired in 92) were maintained.',
  netherlands_air_force:
   '**Netherlands Air Force**: The Dutch Air Force has a single focus of defending the airspace of Western Europe and it is tied directly into the operations of 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force (2 ATAF). Although there are supporting elements there are two key segments to that role: The F-16; and Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) in the form of Patriot and I-Hawk missile units.\n\n![](images/netherlands air force/image001.jpg) **F-16**: As one of the four European nations using the F-16 they were key in the development of the Fokker assembly plant in Holland. In total 213 F-16A/B were acquired (177 single seat ‘A‘ models, and 58 double seat ‘B‘ versions). The first was delivered in 1979 and the last in 1992.\n\nAs a result of the increased tensions in the Northern Fury storyline, upgrade of the older F-16s to the MLU (Mid Life Upgrade) standard, allowing them to use the Aim-120 AMRAAN missile and the AGM-65 Maverick missile began as soon as the last production model was complete. Approximately 42 ‘A‘ models have been upgraded to the MLU standard and equip two Squadrons based at Volkel. Another modification for Dutch F-16s is the ability to operate the Orpheus Reconnaissance Pod, currently 306 Sqn is equipped for this task. No. 315 ‘Lion‘ Squadron was tasked with deploying to Norway in times of emergency as a NATO AMF (ACE Mobile Force) unit.\n\nIn addition to a training squadron in Tucson Arizona, there is a test and evaluation unit stationed at Volkel. Each operational squadron maintains some ‘B‘ model twin seat versions for readiness and refresher training.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\nRemarks\n\n306\n\nHawk\n\nVolkel\n\n18\n\nF-16A Recon\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n311\n\nEagle\n\nVolkel\n\n20\n\nF-16A MLU\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n312\n\nBonzo\n\nVolkel\n\n20\n\nF-16A MLU\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n313\n\nTiger\n\nTwenthe\n\n20\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n314\n\nRedskins\n\nGilze-Rijen\n\n20\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n315\n\nLion\n\nTwenthe\n\n16\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n316\n\nFalcon\n\nEindhoven\n\n20\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n322\n\nPolly Parrot\n\nLeeuwarden\n\n20\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n323\n\nDiana\n\nLeeuwarden\n\n20\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n![](images/netherlands air force/image002.jpg) **F-5A**: Although the NF-5 was retired from service in 1992, the Netherlands Air Force maintains them in ready reserve. 105 aircraft (75 single seat and 30 double seat) are in storage ready to mobilize. It will likely only take 2-3 weeks to organize reserve pilots into new squadrons.\n\n![](images/netherlands air force/image003.jpg) **KDC-10**: Historically the Dutch Air Force received its two KC-10 aerial refuelling aircraft in 1995 but the requirement was identified in 1992 and there were several delays in converting the civilian pattern DC-10 airliners to military refuelling standard. In Northern Fury, the delays were avoided and the two aircraft were delivered to 334th ‘Pegasus‘ Squadron at Eindhoven in late 1994.\n\n**C-130 Hercules**: Also at Eindhoven is 336 Squadron operating 4x C-130H in the transport role.\n\n**Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD)**: The other element fielded by the Netherlands Air Force is GBAD. Each airbase (seven) has an Air Defence (AD) Squadron consisting of 3x I-Hawk missile launchers, 3x Bofors 40L70 gun systems and local ‘Flycatcher‘ radars. Additionally, there are two AD Groups with four squadrons, two each of the older I-HAWK (6 launchers per Squadron), and the newer Patriot missile systems (5 launchers per Squadron). Although only 160 Patriot missiles were purchased, a factory in the Netherlands will produce ~2000 missiles for the US so supply in an emergency should not be a problem. ![](images/netherlands air force/image005.jpg) ![](images/netherlands air force/image006.jpg)',

   'The Royal Netherlands Navy dates back to the 16th century where it was one of the most powerful navies in the world, fighting against most of its European neighbours. Today it is a much more modest force but carries on long standing traditions of duty and seamanship.
