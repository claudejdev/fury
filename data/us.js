   'The United States Navy has been the undisputed naval powerhouse since the Second World War. Not only is it the only Navy to have global reach and power projection with multiple Supper Carriers, but its submarine fleet is arguably unrivalled, except perhaps but the USSR.\n\n![](images/USN cover_files/image001.jpg)\n\nBattle Group Z during the Persian Gulf War\n\n  \n\nHistorically 600 Ship Navy, with the warming of relations between East and West, congress started to reduce funding of new ships and demand retirement of older ships. In Northern Fury however, this warming of relations did not happen and the 600 Ship Navy remained an extant strategy, however reality and budgets do limit target aspirations. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/600-ship_Navy) gives a good summary of the original plan.\n\nThe Rational for the 600 ship Navy can be found on page 25 of this [US Congressional Report](https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/99th-congress-1985-1986/reports/1985_09_futurebudgetrequirements.pdf) from Sept 1985:\n\n![](images/USN cover_files/image002.jpg)\n\nHistorically the 600 ship Navy policy was in rapid decline by the early ‘90s, but in Northern Fury it remains extant with most goals having been achieved by 1994. Some of the key areas where Northern Fury strays from the historic are:\n\n![](images/USN cover_files/image003.jpg)*   The aircraft carrier (CV) USS Ranger (CV-61) was not decommissioned but instead, held in San Diego with reduced crew and no air group as ready reserve. She will be retired when USS John C. Stennis (CGN-74) is commissioned later in 1994 or early 1995.\n*   The USS Forrestal (CV-59) was retained as an air group training carrier.\n*   USS Enterprise (CVN-65) completed an accelerated overhaul 8 months early\n*   All of the Iowa class battleships (BBs) were retained in service\n![](images/USN cover_files/image004.jpg)*   All nuclear powered guided missile cruisers (CGN) were retained. This represents a total of nine ships: 4 x Virginia class, 2 x California class, and the Long Beach, Bainbridge & Truxton.\n*   All Belknap & Leahy class CGs were retained (nine of each) with the NTU (New Threat Upgrades) complete. Combined, the additional 27 CG/CGNs means that a third CG/CGN can deploy with most Carrier Battle Groups (CVBG) as well as act as Flag for smaller Task Groups (TG).\n![](images/USN cover_files/image005.jpg)*   Four of 29 Seawolf Class fleet attack submarines (SSN) have been completed with 3-5 commissioning per year. The Virginia Class has not been designed or considered as it was built as a stop gap when the Seawolf class was canceled. Of all measures taken, this was the most controversial due to the cost of the Seawolf, and the proposals for the Virginia class are quite promising.\n*   28 Sturgeon class plus the 9 long hull (Archerfish) Class, the Narwhal and 3x Permit class SSNs were retained. The Permit‘s followed by the Sturgeons will decommission as the Seawolf class comes on line. A stable fleet size of 100 fleet attack boats and 9-10 special mission boats will be maintained.\n![](images/USN cover_files/image006.jpg)*   Seven Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers (DDG), called the DDG-51 class have been completed with 5-6 per year planned to the culminate at 62 units.\n*   Because of the urgent need for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) escorts, the shortage of dry-dock space and the increased number of Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) carrying ships; the last 7 of 31 Spruance class destroyers (DD) will not be upgraded to carry the Vertical Launch missile System (VLS) but will remain ASW DDs and undergo shorter mid-life refits than the other 24 ships. The 4 Kidd Class DDGs received their NTU in the late 80‘s and will serve another 20 years.\n*   The Farragut Class DDGs have been retained, 6x NTU refits have been completed, all based on the East Coast, with the remaining four completing later in 1994.\n![](images/USN cover_files/image007.jpg)*   Only three Charles F. Adams NTU DDGs are ready but another 12 are undergoing refit which will be completed in the next 18 months. Both of the older DDG classes (Farragut and Charles F. Adams) will serve until ~2000 when enough of the Arleigh Burke‘s are available to relieve them.\n*   The 51 unit Oliver Hazard Perry (OHP) Class Guided Missile Frigate (FFG) had completed commissioning in 89 with no replacement on the horizon. The Navy pointed out this gap to Congress and a further 12 were ordered in 91 with the first four already launched and due to commission later in 1994. As a stop-gap four Brooke Class FFG‘s (FFG-3-6) were retained, but will decommission later this year. A ‘Follow on Frigate‘ program is underway with a bid for 72 units, the first being laid down in early 95 and will replace both the OHP and the Knox Class in the escort role. The OHP will average 30 years of service when decommissioned.\n![](images/USN cover_files/image008.jpg)*   36 of the 46 ship Knox class Frigates (FF) remain in service, the remaining 10 are mothballed. The problem plagued design will be replaced by the ‘Follow on Frigate‘ program on a 2 for 1 basis starting in 1996 with most only serving 25-27 years. (Historic real life service was only 23 years).\n![](images/USN cover_files/image009.jpg)\n\nGraphically the comparison between the historic goal and the Northern Fury programme looks like this:\n\n\\>Total Other\n\nUSN Fleet size - Northern Fury Campaign vs 600 Ship Plan\n\n**Historic**\n\n**Northern Fury**\n\n1985\n\nGoal\n\nReady\n\nReserve\n\nLaunching\n\nTotal\n\nNotes\n\nCV/CVN\n\n13\n\n15\n\n13\n\n2\n\n1\n\n16\n\nCV-61 to retire when CVN-74 commissions\n\nBB\n\n2\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\nCG/CGN\n\n98\n\n137\n\n54\n\n54\n\nTotal of 124, DDG-51s coming online, older CG/CGNs to retire over time\n\nDD/DDG\n\n67\n\n3\n\n70\n\nFF/FFG\n\n108\n\n101\n\n90\n\n11\n\n4\n\n105\n\nFirst 4 of 12 new OHPs arrives, Brooks to retire\n\nSSN\n\n98\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\nSSN/Sp\n\n9\n\n9\n\nSpecial purpose, mostly SOF delivery\n\nSmall\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6\n\n6\n\nPegasus Class FAC\n\n**Total Combat**\n\n325\n\n357\n\n337\n\n19\n\n8\n\n364\n\nAmphib\n\n62\n\n75\n\n70\n\n70\n\nMine Warfare\n\n3\n\n31\n\n30\n\n10\n\n40\n\nReplen\n\n53\n\n69\n\n58\n\n58\n\nMat Support\n\n25\n\n27\n\n26\n\n26\n\nFleet Support\n\n29\n\n33\n\n29\n\n29\n\n172\n\n235\n\n213\n\n223\n\nSSBN\n\n37\n\n36\n\n36\n\n10\n\n36\n\n**Total All**\n\n534\n\n628\n\n586\n\n29\n\n8\n\n623\n\n![](images/USN cover_files/image010.jpg)',
  US_air_force:
   'The United States Air Force (USAF) in 1994 had historically been reduced by 30% from a 1986 strength of around 608,000 to 426,000 and was shrinking rapidly. In Northern Fury, due to increased tensions in Europe and around the globe, the strength is reduced from the mid ‘80s but by a much smaller margin. The Northern Fury USAF has about 600,000 personnel in 1994 and this number has been stable for the past two years. Many of the changes implemented by the various BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure Commission) reviews (1988, 1991, 1993) do not occur, realignment where it was reasonable happened but most bases remain open, specifics are noted where it makes a difference. Structurally the changes that occurred historically remain extant because they made sense in an evolving world. The fundamental structure of the USAF looks like this:\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image001.png)\n\n**Air Combat Command**: Air Combat Command (ACC), headquartered at Langley AFB, Virginia, is the primary provider of combat air forces to reinforce regional commands around the globe or to defend North America. ACC‘s main focus is the training and preparation of combat ready fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, rescue and Battle management forces for rapid deployment or employment. This is a large command with over 230,000 regular and reserve personnel and over 1,000 aircraft.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image002.png)\n\n**Air Mobility Command**: Air Mobility Command (AMC) is another very large command which provides the USAF and the US Armed Forces as a whole with global rapid deployment options. This command is constantly busy performing air lift, air refueling, aeromedical evacuations and many other minor tasks every day of the year. With 125,000 personnel and about 925 airframes, this is the second largest command in the Air Force.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image003.png)\n\n**Pacific Air Forces**: Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) are the USAF‘s forward deployed combat and support elements in the Pacific theatre. Although relatively small with 46,000 personnel and about 330 aircraft, this still represents a significant force in the region, over 260 of the aircraft being front line combat types. One of the major tasks performed by PACAF, besides deterrence, is to train with Asian and Australian Air Forces as a way of leveraging the combat power of those nations toward a unified command system.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image004.png)\n\n**US Air Force in Europe**: US Air Force in Europe (USAFE) with its HQ at Ramstein, Germany, supplies forces to Allied Command Europe (ACE) through dedicated air wings under the control of the various NATO Air Forces. 2 and 4 Allied Tactical Air Force (ATAF) in northern Europe are both under the command of Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AIRCENT), essentially USAFE HQ under a different name. For forces allocated to southern Europe, primarily 16th US Air Force, NATO‘s 5 and 6 ATAF will control operations under the direction of Allied Air Forces Southern Europe (AIRSOUTH) located at Naples Italy.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the most significant impact of Northern Fury‘s changes occur in Europe. Historically, after ‘Peace Dividend‘ reductions, only eight Fighter Squadrons in three wings remained in Europe with about 175 front line combat aircraft. In Northern Fury, there are 12 Fighter Wings remaining in Europe, with 28 Squadrons and another 8 are on immediate recall from the Continental US (CONUS). This totals up as 860 front line aircraft and between 50 and 100 tankers, transport and reconnaissance aircraft in support. USAFE will grow well beyond this as the well-practiced flyover reinforcement program continues, swelling to more than double this number.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image005.png) ![](images/The United States Air Force/image006.png)\n\n**Air Force Special Operation Command**: Based at Hurlburt Field, Florida, the Air Force Special Operation Command (AFSOC) only became a separate command in May of 1990 when the former 23rd Air Force was re-designated to this role. AFSOC has a wide ranging list of tasks including:\n\n*   Providing combat controllers for air to ground coordination of airpower. This function is being consolidated within AFSOC from ACC, PACAF and USAFE but the capacity remains in those commands\n*   Providing Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) services worldwide\n*   Operating all airborne weather services for US Army and USAF worldwide, as well as providing aircraft to NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) which includes the US National Weather Service.\n*   Operating airborne psychological operations platforms.\n*   Operating a squadron of AC-130 Spectre gunships for close air support\n*   Operating a fleet of ‘Combat Talon‘ C-130 special mission aircraft for stealthy infiltration of special forces personnel.\n*   Operating a fleet of ‘Combat Shadow‘ C-130 special mission refueling aircraft.\n*   Operating a fleet of ‘Pave Low‘ and ‘Pave Hawk‘ helicopters for CSAR, insertion and extraction missions.\n\nAFSOC is a small, agile organization which runs its own school, test and evaluation unit and deployable Command and Control elements. Operating a fleet of over 100 special mission C-130s, 36 MH-53 heavy lift helicopters and several MH-60‘s, this force can deploy elements globally either as individual aircraft or as mission tailored groups on very short notice.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image007.png)\n\n**Air Force Space Command**: Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is another new command, it was established in 1982 to control all US military satellites, launch vehicles, space tracking and ballistic missile warning systems. The role of AFSPC increased substantially in 1993 when it inherited responsibility for all Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM) from the defunct Strategic Air Command (SAC). Additionally, the commander of AFSC is also the commander of the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), the bi-lateral command between the US and Canada for defending North American airspace from intrusion. This relatively small command has about 39,000 personnel, half of them civilian, but is located in over 80 locations around the world. Two numbered Air Forces in the command coordinate and control 580 ICBMs and over 50 communications, GPS, reconnaissance, ballistic missile warning and weather satellites.\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image008.png)\n\n**Air Force Reserve**: In 1994, the Air Force Reserve (AFR) is an agency within the Air Force, it does not become a command until 1997. As an element with 80,000 personnel and nearly 500 aircraft however, the Reserve is a major component of the USAF. Many of the wings and squadrons of the AFR are ‘associated‘ with regular USAF wings and squadrons, primarily in AMC where the aircrew often share aircraft or combine regular and reserve on the same crew. Within the AFR structure there are three numbered Air Forces, 37 wings, 128 groups and about 400 squadrons (many without aircraft). There are some minor changes due to the Northern Fury setting but nothing significant. Not all detail is shown in the diagram below:\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image009.png)\n\n**Air Force National Guard**: Commonly referred to simply as the ‘Air Guard‘ or simply the ‘Guard‘ this is another large element of the USAF with over 111,000 personnel flying in 88 wings from every state of the country. The Air Guard provides trained units and people directly to the other commands. Unlike the ARS, these units belong to the State Governors until federalized for operations. Standing agreements exist for NORAD and many other domestic activities, but special permissions are needed to deploy Air Guard units overseas. No numbered Air Forces are operated by the Air Guard and many wings consist of only one squadron. Northern Fury has some significant changes that impact this element, primarily because the active air force maintains many squadrons that were historically deactivated. By 1994 the Air Guard was receiving a significant number of very new aircraft as regular units closed down, but since that does not happen, the Guard was maintaining many older aircraft until production of newer airframes could catch up to demand. The Air Guard flies over 1,500 aircraft in 109 squadrons as follows:\n\n*   7x F-15A Squadrons of 24 aircraft each, 3 are for NORAD, one is in Hawaii;\n*   29x F-16ADF Squadrons of 18 aircraft each, 14 are for NORAD;\n*   3x F-16 Block 25 Squadrons of 24 aircraft each;\n*   1x F-16 Block 50 Squadron of 24 aircraft, half of that Squadron is in the Persian Gulf;\n*   3x F-4E Squadrons of 24 aircraft each;\n*   1x F-4G ‘Wild Weasel‘ Squadron of 24 aircraft;\n*   2x RF-4C ‘Reconnaissance‘ Squadrons of 18 aircraft each;\n*   3x A7D Squadrons of 18 aircraft each;\n*   5x A-10 Squadrons of 18 aircraft each;\n*   1x EC-130E ‘Commando Solo‘ Squadron of 8 aircraft;\n*   19x C-130E/H varying between 8 and 12 aircraft each (1 Sqn is forming and has 5);\n*   2x C-141B Squadrons of 8 aircraft each;\n*   1x C-5A Squadron of 8 aircraft;\n*   1x CT-43A Squadron of 6 aircraft working with ATEC;\n*   1x C-21A Squadron with 4 aircraft for VIP transport;\n*   20x KC-135 Squadrons with 7 to 10 aircraft each;\n*   1x T-38 Squadron with around 32 aircraft working for ATEC;\n*   1x C-130E Training Squadron with 10 aircraft working for ATEC;\n*   1x F-4G/RF-4C Training Squadron with at least 12 of each working for ATEC;\n*   2x C-130P Rescue Squadrons with 5 aircraft each\n*   2x HH-60 Rescue Squadrons with 8 aircraft each\n*   1x Mixed Rescue Squadron with 4x C-130P and 6x HH-60.\n*   2x Rescue Jumper Squadrons.\n\n**Air Force Training and Education Command**: The Training Command (ATEC) is worth noting simply because of the scale at which the USAF conducts training. At any time, there are over 60,000 assigned personnel and around 350,000 students within the command. Although flight training is only one of many functions of ATEC, it operates over 1,500 aircraft in two numbers air forces, including over 350 front line aircraft!\n\n![](images/The United States Air Force/image010.png)\n\n**Air Force Materiel Command**: Procurement, life cycle management, testing and evaluation as well as routine logistic support is the role of the AFMC. With over 115,000 personnel and operating 40 different types of aircraft, this is a large command. AFMC also operates the ‘Test Pilot‘ school and works with industry to develop and evolve aircraft.\n\n**Northern Fury**: With the significant increase of tensions in Europe caused by the Northern Fury storyline, US lawmakers and hawks amongst the defense community watched a resurgence of hard liners with a mix of caution and anger. Increased Soviet aggressiveness as early as 1989 and then the 1991 coup that deposed Gorbachev signaled a change in the path of history. Tensions rapidly ramped up as the Soviet Union exerted pressure on Poland and Germany with the apparent goal of minimalizing NATO‘s and ultimately the United States‘ influence on Europe. As a reaction to these developments the US Government embarked on a program to rejuvenate the Reagan era programs of the 1980‘s. Three major initiatives were undertaken to stem the decline of combat power within the air force:\n\n1.  As mentioned earlier, halting the base and wing closures recommended by the various BRAC committees allowed the structure of the USAF to remain relatively unchanged, from the late ‘80s.\n2.  In order to maintain force levels, several airframes were retained in service longer than they were historically. A major impact of this was on the Air Guard, as they did not receive the windfall of new equipment in the early ‘90s. Several squadrons still fly F-4 Phantom and A-7 Corsairs, and many more retained the legacy F-16ADF (Air Defense Variant). There is a smattering of other airframes that will be retained longer than planned such as the F-4G Wild Wesel, the F-111F and B-52G, these will be mentioned in the detailed aircraft section later.\n3.  Ramping up, or more accurately, not ramping down of production. Although there are some specialty aircraft that this policy affects such as the EC/MC/AC-130 series where Northern Fury sees about 27 more airframes in use, the big impact is in front line fighter aircraft and the B-2 Bomber.\n    1.  A total of eight B-2 Spirit bombers are in service (AV-7 to AV-12, plus AV-5 & 6 held by ATEC). These have formed the 393rd Bomb Squadron at Whiteman AFB. Training, testing and evaluation is ongoing with the two ATEC airframes not ready for immediate operations.\n    2.  The F-15E Strike Eagle, all 200 ordered plus 6 replacement aircraft had been delivered by early 1992, a further order was placed for 100 airframes early enough to continue production at capacity (42/year) until 1993. Therefore, an additional three squadrons are available and the 6th Fighter Wing at Mountain Home AFB was formed. 550th Fighter Squadron, the operational conversion unit for this type is due to deactivate later in 1994, but remains extant within ATEC when Northern Fury commences.\n    3.  The single largest impact of retained production is the F-16 Falcon. Historically the late ‘80s and early ‘90s saw a massive downsizing and sell-off of this ubiquitous and versatile fighter. Many went to the Air Guard, many others went into long term preservation and yet more were sold to allies. In Northern Fury the 1988 level of production (180/year) was maintained right through 1993 and is planned to continue for at least 3 more years. Factoring in a slightly higher level of attrition, this production results in an additional 442 airframes being available, all at the Block 40/42 and 50/52 standard. Combined with retaining some older aircraft in the Air Guard, not retiring many F-16ADF, and canceling several foreign sales a net increase of 15x F-16 Squadrons are available to USAF.',
  US_army:
   'The United States Army is a large and powerful force, technologically advanced, generally well trained, and at a relatively high state of readiness. The 1980‘s was a decade of change for the US Army. Coming out of the Viet Nam era, the new professional (vice conscript) force adopted new organizations, new training methods, new equipment, new tactics and overall a completely new concept of integration of combat power. The US Army of 1994 had been tested during Operation Desert Shield/Storm in Iraq and, although there was some improvement to make, proved to a great extent that the reforms had worked beyond the imagination of most.\n\nThe US Army in Europe through the latter part of the Cold war was the focus of the entire army structure. Led by 7th Army HQ, two full Corps (V & VII) were largely stationed in Germany with a third Corps (III Corps) based in the US but having pre-positioned equipment holdings in POMCUS (Prepositioning Of Materiel Configured in Unit Sets) sites. Although problematic due to maintenance, cost, security and standardization, this system was exercised rigorously in the annual REFORGER (REturn of FORces to GERmany) [Exercises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Reforger). By 1989 the POMCUS system was set up to rapidly deploy six divisions, support elements and logistics to Germany, within 10 days, to reinforce the four divisions permanently stationed there. Historically this system came to a sudden end following the Gulf War, when VII Corps and over half of the forces in Germany were repatriated and rapidly deactivated.\n\nIn the Northern Fury world the US Army has experienced some difficulty obtaining consistent and clear government direction since the fall of the Berlin wall. The massive effort in the Gulf War was supposed to be the closing act to the Germany based VII Corps which, due to budgetary pressure to reduce spending, was due to deactivate in the early ‘90s. The increased tension from a resurgent Soviet Union has interrupted that plan mid stride - inconvenient for both military and budgetary planners. The end result is that some repatriation has occurred but some plans were canceled and others modified. The main points of impact are:\n\n*   7th US Army HQ remains in Europe (double hatted as CENTAG HQ)\n*   The 18 Division structure established by the Reagan administration remains, therefore\n    *   2nd Armored Division is not deactivated (planned for 1995)\n    *   3rd Armored Division is not deactivated (in 1992)\n    *   5th Infantry Division (Mech) is not deactivated (in 1992)\n    *   6th Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated (reduced to one Bde in 94, removed 98)\n    *   7th Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated (in 1994)\n    *   8th Infantry Division (Mech) is not deactivated (in 1992)\n    *   9th Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated (in 1991)\n    *   Additionally all National Guard and Army Reserve ‘Training‘ Divisions remain extant\n*   VII US Corps HQ remains in Europe but with a reduced staff and structure:\n    *   1st Armored Division moved to the US with 3rd Brigade remaining in Germany\n    *   3rd Infantry Division moved to the US with 3rd Brigade remaining in Germany\n    *   77nd and 210th Artillery Brigades moved to the US with a POMCUS site in Germany\n    *   7th Combat Engineer Brigade is transferred from VII Corps to 7th Army\n    *   197th Infantry Brigade (REFORGER) is transferred to 7th Army as CENTAG reserve\n    *   207th Military Intelligence Brigade is transferred to 7th Army for general support\n*   The ‘Berlin‘ Brigade is due to deactivate in July of 1994.\n*   56th Artillery Brigade, has exchanged its deactivated Pershing missile systems for M270 MLRS armed with MGM-140 ATacMS (Army Tactical Missile System) and remains a direct reporting unit to 7th Army HQ.\n*   The POMCUS program was expanded to include six more Brigade size sets of equipment; 2 for 1st Armored Division, 2 for 3rd Infantry Division, and 2 for the two artillery brigades.\n*   In order to maintain enhanced security in Kuwait, 187th Infantry Brigade Army Reserve has been activated. This is a unique structure as Battlegroup size elements from the standing army, National Guard and Reserve rotated through this Bde on an 8 month tour of duty. While in Kuwait they undergo a rigorous training program to enhance their combat capability.\n\nIt should also be noted that divisions based solely in the continental US (CONUS) except 82nd Airborne and 101st Air Assault Divisions, only had two active brigades. The third brigade was either National Guard or Army Reserve and these, although equipped the same as the active units, would take a minimum of 30 days to deploy.\n\nDuring the turmoil of the post ‘Gulf War‘ moves manning in the Army remained relatively constant. Although there was an initial dip in strength due to planned downsizing in 91-92, it has largely been made up in 93. The strength as of Jan 1994 is slightly smaller than its recent peak in the late ‘80s but about 200,000 more than historic - totals of the US Army is:\n\n*   Army: 755,000\n*   Army National Guard: 450,000\n*   Army Reserve: 582,000\n\n**Structure**: Within the continental US (CONUS) there are six army level HQs (1st Army to 6th Army), these are primarily tasked a mobilization role in times of national crisis. They can be activated for operations such as 3rd Army in the Gulf war. The two active armies, 7th Army in Europe and 8th Army in Korea are on full operational status. Within CONUS all active duty units are assigned to Corps and most have a wartime deployment role. The Corps in CONUS are:\n\n![](images/United States Army/image001.jpg) **I Corps**: This is a small Corps charged with experimentation and development, but also has emergency deployment tasks. It is likely that I Corp would deploy to US Army Pacific, probably with 7th Infantry Division (ID), along with its artillery, aviation and air defence brigades. 9th ID is a very unique formation; it is the testbed light wheeled vehicles and rapid ground mobility. This division was earmarked to deploy to Northern Germany or Denmark, however its lightly armored infantry ((HMMWV or Desert Patrol Vehicles), combined with only having two tanks battalions (in its National Guard round-out brigade) may have precluded its employment on that front. Its high speed cross country mobility, on the other hand made the unit ideal for desert operations.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image002.png)\n\n**III Corps**: The complete opposite of I Corps, this corps is a massive organization which is destined for Europe in its entirety. An initial glance at the organization is misleading however. III Corps, in addition to its own formations, is a holding organization for 7th Army in Europe. Divisions tasked with rapidly reinforcing both Europe based Corps through REFORGER are held under command of III Corps for training and administration while in CONUS, their parent Corps have operational command however. III Corps will deploy to northern Germany and operate as part of NORTHAG (British Army on the Rhine) while formations supporting V & VII Corps will be under command of CENTAG (7th US Army).\n\n![](images/United States Army/image003.png)\n\nIt is worth noting that the POMCUS policy was to move 6, now 8 divisions to Germany in less than 10 days: 1st Cav, 1st ID, 1st AD, 2nd AD, 3rd ID, 4th ID, 5th ID, 194th Armd Bde\\*, 197th Inf Bde\\*, 3 ACR, 212th FA Bde plus two more FA Bdes for Northern Fury. The last division (unless you count the three independent Bdes as a division) is 9th ID from I Corps, which would fly over in its entirety. The feasibility of all but the 9th ID deployment was well practiced, as discussed earlier, 9th ID was not well suited to the north German plain. (\\*From XVIII Airborne Corps below)\n\n**XVIII Airborne Corps**: Commonly referred to as ‘America‘s Contingency Corps‘ this organization has seen a lot of recent action and deployed to the Sini peninsula in 1982, Grenada in 1983, Panama in 1989 and the Gulf war in 1991. Similar to III Corps above, this formation is also charged with holding elements destined for Europe, but the main elements of the corps are its three rapid deployment divisions, each one unique. 82nd Airborne Division has a battalion task force on 24 hours notice to move anywhere on the globe, at all times, and the remainder of a brigade moving within 3 days. The 101st Air Assault Division maintains an aviation brigade with over 320 helicopters; more than most nations operate. 10th Mountain Division is capable of moving by air to anywhere in the world within 10 days. 10th Mountain has a National Guard round-out brigade but both of the other divisions are fully manned standing army units.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image004.png)\n\n**US Army Europe**: Commanded by 7th Army HQ, also acting as NATO CENTAG, these two Corps and supporting units have been the focal point of US Army training and development since the end of the Korean War. After the post-Gulf War reductions this force is at its lowest point in terms of manning since 1950, with only two fully manned divisions, six independent or forward positioned brigades and two armored cavalry regiments. Given 10 days to mobilize, 7th Army or CENTAG would be a powerful force indeed, with 10 American, 7 German, 3 French and one Canadian division at its disposal. Ten days is a long time in a modern conflict however.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image005.png)\n\n**US Army Pacific**: US Army Pacific is a diverse and dispersed organization. Commanded by Commander 8th Army with his HQ in South Korea and having forces in Alaska, Hawaii and Japan, this army relies very heavily on its allies and the USAF to add armor and firepower to the fight.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image006.png)\n\n**US Army South**: The 193rd Infantry Brigade is the only regular army unit in this command. The primary purpose of this brigade is security of the Panama Canal Zone, but it also assists the Panamanian Government and other US agencies in conducting counter insurgency and counter narcotics operations.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image007.png)\n\n**US Army Kuwait**: In the three years following the Gulf War, tensions in the region have increased, primarily because Iran has become increasingly hostile towards the West and Iraq. In all likelihood this resurgent hostility is linked to improved Iranian relations with the Soviet Union. Therefore, in order to maintain enhanced security in Kuwait, the 187th Infantry Brigade, Army Reserve has been activated. The brigade is a shining example of the ‘Total Force‘ concept within the US Army, the HQ, an infantry battalion, 5-5th Artillery Battalion HQ and one battery, Engineer Company and Cavalry Troop are from the Army Reserve. The regular army and the National Guard provide a battalion and an artillery battery each to the force. Each battalion rotates in for an 8-month tour of duty and mans in-place equipment, conducts an intensive training program and then returns home. The battalions rotate at 4 month intervals and routinely train with Kuwaiti and Saudi forces.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image008.png)\n\n**US Army Special Operations Command**: The US Army Special Operations Command (USA SOC) is a relatively new organization, formed in 1989 when all Special Forces were place under the control of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). This force, trains, equips, maintains and deploys Special Forces elements worldwide. Combined with US Navy and US Air Force Special Operations elements operating under the control of SOCOM, it can precipitate strategic effect with a comparatively minor force commitment.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image009.png)\n\n**US Army Reserve**: The Army Reserve is a force of 582,000 personnel, 1/3rd of the total strength of the army. Although the vast majority are ‘part time‘ soldiers, they are well trained and equipped, subject to immediate recall and many have regular army experience. Part of the reserve structure are the 10 ‘Training Division‘ HQs, their primary function is to be a focus for mobilization, training and equipping mobilized troops, and perhaps commanding those troops as a follow on formation, or providing replacements for battle losses. Another factor to consider when examining the diagram below, logistics units are not included, and a large portion of the Army Reserve are logistics units.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image010.png)\n\n**The US Army National Guard**: The National Guard (NG) represents 25% of the deployable army and is a fundamental element in the ability of the US Army to succeed in battle. Over 60,000 National Guardsmen deployed to the Gulf War including two formed artillery brigades. The Gulf War also pointed out some shortcomings in NG readiness and a program has been put in place to rectify these. Some units are equipped with the latest generation of equipment while most use slightly older kit, but even that is the same or better than some NATO allies. Four of the NG division HQs, as well as the IX Corps HQ, at least one artillery brigade and probably several other elements have a follow on reinforcement role to NATO. Readiness levels have improved since the Gulf War as have training programs. Most units should be ready to deploy within 30-45 days of mobilization while some will take up to 60 days of training with some re-equipping. It is likely that more than 50,000 NG troops will deploy individually or in small units within the first 14 days of mobilization including up to five artillery brigades, two engineer brigades and one or two aviation brigades.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image011.png)\n\n### Equipment\n\n**Main Battle Tank (MBT)**\n\n**[M1](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m1.htm)**: The extremely successful M1 Abrams MBT began production in 1979 and continued through 1985 when the last of 3,273 were produced for the US Army. This is a 61 ton tanks with a 105mm rifled gun, it can travel at 45 MPH (72 KPH) and has a range of 310 miles (500 Km). This is an excellent, reliable, well proven tank, it has the same gun as the Leopard 1, but is 50% heavier and has a shorter range. The main concern with this MBT is high fuel usage requiring additional logistic support. After sales to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, upgrades to later variants and general attrition are factored in; there are 1630 basic M1s available to the US Army in 1994.\n\n**M1IP**: This version has improved engine performance, efficiency, and better turret armor but in most other ways is the same as the M1. There were 894 produced in 1984.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image012.jpg) **M1A1**: This tank, in addition to other improvements, replaced the gun with the 120mm Smooth bore cannon, the same gun that is on the Leopard 2. In comparison the M1A1 is heavier but achieves the same speed (42 MPH/68 KPH) over a longer distance 288 miles (463 Km) versus the Leopard 2 which achieves a range of 211 miles (340 Km). By 1992 there were 4,976 M1A1s produced.\n\n**M1A2**: Although 190 were produced by 1994, there were about 1000 M1s upgraded to a similar configuration as the M1A1 in particular upgrading the gun. They also had a second thermal site for the commander allowing rapid engagement subsequent targets at night or in obscured conditions. Total available in early 1994 is 1,190.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image013.jpg) **[M60A3](http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/M60_Patton.php)**: Built in the 1980s, the latest version of the ‘Patton‘ MBT carried the same British made L7, 105mm riffled gun as the M1 Abrams, with a fire control system that produced a 70% hit probability of another tank at 2000 meters. By the time production stopped over 1700 of these tanks had been built and another 1700 older models had been converted to this standard.\n\n**Disposition of MBTs**: As the M1A2 Abrams continues to be produced, an ongoing program is cascading newer MBTs across the entire army. Formations assigned to REFORGER have a higher requirement as they need to provide a fill set of equipment to the POMCUS site, while maintaining a partial set for training in CONUS. Formation assigned to 7th Army Europe, both permanently stationed and REFORGER units require approximately 5,300 MBTs, 1,800 of which will cascade to NG units upon mobilization. Other active army users such as I Corps, 24th ID and PACOM require another 500 MBTs. All of these units are also equipped with the M1A1 or M1A2 Abrams MBTs. Army Reserve elements, NG independent armored battalions and brigades as well as the armored battalions in independent infantry brigades and armored cavalry regiments are equipped with the M1IP. The remaining formations are a mix of basic M1 MBTs and M60A3s.\n\n**Armored support vehicles**: All armored support vehicles are based on the M60 chassis. Although some support vehicles based on the M1 are in development, they are several years from fielding. These are spread throughout the force:\n\n*   312 x M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle (CEV)\n*   400 x M60 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB)\n*   1,427 x M88A1 Armored Recovery Vehicles (ARV)\n*   896 x M88 upgraded to A1 standard\n\n![](images/United States Army/image014.jpg) **[M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV)](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m2.htm)**: The Bradley is the standard infantry vehicle in the mechanized forces of the US Army. It is armed with a 25mm ‘Bushmaster‘ chain gun, has a crew of three and carries six soldiers able to dismount to clear the enemy. By 1994 initial production was complete and upgrading older versions to meet the latest standard was underway, this is several months faster then happened historically. In total 4,641 M2s were built with over half being built to the A2 ‘high survivability‘ standard. All but the first 1,600 A0 variants also carried a TOW 2 missile launch system. M2 disposition is roughly equivalent to the M1A2 laydown, with Germany based units and POMCUS sites having the latest A2 variants and CONUS based units, Reserve or NG having the A0.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image015.jpg) **[M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV)](http://www.military-today.com/apc/m3_bradley.htm)**: Almost identical to the M2 in appearance, the M3 only carries two dismounts, with the remainder of the space used for extra radios, storage and ammunition for the TOW missile systems. In all, 2,083 CFVs were built and issued to all armored cavalry units, including NG units. These had the same variant details as the M2 and once again, Germany has the latest equipment while the older variants requiring refit are in CONUS.\n\n**[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) Family](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m113.htm)**: This versatile and reliable family of vehicles has been in use for over 30 years in the US Army and has found its way into over 50 other armies around the world. Some 34,000, primarily the standard ‘Battlefield Taxi‘ variant were produced for the US, while over 80,000 were produced worldwide. These vehicles are used in virtually every mechanized unit in the army and are often pushed into roles they were not designed for. In 1994 the following are in the inventory:\n\n*   Approximately 16,000 x A1, A2 or A3 variant standard troop carrier.\n*   1,600 x M113A4 Armored Medical Evacuation Vehicle (AMEV)\n*   1950 x M106 mortar carriers with 107mm (4.2in) mortars.\n*   1275 x M125 mortar carriers with 81mm mortars.\n*   4000+ x M548 ammunition carrier.\n*   5000+ x M577 command post vehicle.\n*   3300 x M901 Self Propelled (SP) TOW-2 missile launchers.\n*   1000+ x M981 Fire Support Team Vehicle (FIST V)\n*   600 x M730A2 Guided Missile Equipment Carrier (Chaparral)\n\n![](images/United States Army/image016.jpg)\n\n**Artillery**: The US Army has vast quantities of artillery systems to outfit the 48 artillery brigades across the force. Each division has a DivArty Bde generally consisting of a 155mm battalion with 18 guns working as Close Support each maneuver brigade, plus a battery of MLRS (M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System) and a target acquisition battery in General Support. 82nd and 101st divisions have 105mm Close Support battalions and a 155mm General Support Battalion. The 30 independent brigades have a wide range of configurations and are meant to provide the Corps and Army commanders flexibility by supporting the main effort divisions with extra fire power. Key artillery systems are:\n\n*   1100+ x [M101](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m101a1.htm) & [M102](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m102.htm) towed 105mm howitzers.\n*   150 x [M119](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m119.htm) (Light Gun) towed, air portable 105mm howitzers.\n*   2,400+ x [M109A2](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m109.htm)/A3/A4 SP 155mm howitzers.\n*   <100 x M109A6 [Paladin](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m109a6.htm) SP Autonomous howitzers (24th ID).\n*   1000+ x [M198](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m198.htm) towed 155mm howitzers.\n*   526 x [M114](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m114.htm) towed 155mm howitzers.\n*   1046 x [M110A2](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m110a2.htm) SP 203mm howitzers.\n*   750+ x M270 SP [MLRS](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m270.htm) (replacing all Lance and Pershing systems)\n*   35- x MGM-52 [Lance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM-52_Lance) SSMs, conventional warheads only, retiring.\n\n![](images/United States Army/image017.jpg)\n\n![](images/United States Army/image018.jpg) **Air Defence systems**: The 10 Air Defence Artillery (ADA) brigades across the army are allocated roughly one per Corps with additional brigades under army control. There are some independent units supporting fixed installations. Each brigade is unique and task tailored for the rolls and responsibilities it has been given. Generally, US Army ADA is focused on the High Level and the Very Low Level air defence threats, leaving medium level threats to other nations or NATO air forces to deal with. The systems in inventory are:\n\n*   220 x [M167](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M167_VADS) towed 20mm Vulcan.\n*   360 x [M163](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M163_VADS) SP 20mm Vulcan.\n*   1060 x [Stinger](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/stinger.htm) missile launchers (13,000 missiles).\n*   500+ x [Avenger](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/avenger.htm) HUMMWV mounted Stinger missile launcher.\n*   600 x [Chaparral](https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m730.htm) SP.\n*   500+ x [MIM-104](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot) Patriot SP High level missile system\n*   400+ x [I-Hawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-23_Hawk#I-Hawk:_MIM-23B) towed High level missile system',
