    "overview",
    "<h3>Northern Fury (Alternate Cold War History)</h3> <p> On the 19th of August 1991, hard-liners in the Soviet leadership, calling themselves the ‘State Emergency Committee‘, launched the ‘August Coup‘ in order to remove Gorbachev from power and prevent the signing of the new union treaty. Although experiencing some initial setbacks and resounding world condemnation - the coup was a success. The concepts of Perestroika and Glasnost, and the economic and political restructuring they implied, were abolished overnight. Independence movements in 14 states were ruthlessly quashed, including those in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Georgia where self-rule had already been declared. Internal strife reminiscent of the 1920‘s lasted for just over a month but the iron rule of the reinvigorated Communist Party prevailed in all areas. </p> <p> NATO watched nervously as their efforts to encourage Eastern European countries away from Dictatorship were methodically dashed. Only Poland and the re-unified Germany managed to avoid the restoration of the Warsaw Pact. Poland has declared itself Neutral and Non-aligned; however significant pro Eastern Bloc movements exist and are in a constant struggle with its emerging Capitalist economy. Germany is in a difficult position as many of its Left Wing political elements have been proposing the abandonment of collective defense as a viable strategy for the future. </p> <p> Meanwhile, NATO was decisively engaged as its (original 16) various governments were attempting to realize the ‘peace dividend‘ by reducing military forces, and employing what is left in non-traditional roles in order to justify costs. With significantly reduced Land, Sea and Air forces embroiled in the Balkans, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Rwanda and The Sudan. Resources are spread thinner than they have been since the 1940‘s. Tensions with Iraq are high and the threat to stability in the Middle East is extreme. </p> <p> On the 9th of February 1994, a Soviet supported Coup toppled the Polish government and sent the emergent democratic state into anarchy. The UN Security council response was futile and an emergency sitting of NATO‘s North Atlantic Council (NAC) was called for the 12th of February. </p> <p> In Norway - The International Olympic Committee (IOC), in consultation with the UN decided to carry on with the Winter Games which were opened in Lillehammer, on February 12th. Soviet and Eastern Bloc countries were represented at the opening ceremonies but many of their athletes were not present at the start of the actual events on the 13th, the Russian Olympic village was empty and initial investigation found that many of the athletes had simply disappeared, while only a few had flown home. Norway has called up its reserves and ordered the IOC to cancel the games and evacuate the Olympic Village. The world is in an uproar over the loss of the Olympic spectacle and TV commentators all over the Globe are criticizing Norway‘s decision. </p>"

    '<h3>Caribbean Fury Background and Scenarios</h3> <p> </p><figure style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <img src="assets/images/caribbean/image001.jpg"> <figcaption>CV-67 USS John F Kennedy</figcaption> </figure> <b>Caribbean Fury Background:</b> The short Caribbean series represents events running parallel to the early days of Northern Fury. The Soviet Foreign Service has been actively instigating trouble in America‘s back yard. U.S. domestic difficulties and a global ‘Post-Cold War‘ malaise made western response to the evolving issues fragmented, conflicting and generally ineffective. <p></p> <p> In Nicaragua, American withdrawal of all support to the Contra‘s after the Iran-Contra fiasco allowed the Sandinista‘s breathing space; however, when the anti-Sandinista ‘Chamorro‘ government won the election in 1990 the revolutionary movement immediately restarted, ending in a bloody coup in 92 with a Soviet leaning Sandinista Junta in control. A major funding proposal involved the planning and eventual building of a Nicaraguan Canal to compete with Panama, financing, construction and control of which would be from Moscow. </p> <p> <img src="assets/images/caribbean/image002.jpg" style="max-width:320px;float:left;margin:12px;"> Although Honduras maintained a marginally effective government with significant US aid through the 80‘s, the cessation of funding and support of the Contras in Nicaragua left a power vacuum which the US-trained army could not effectively fill. By 1989 the Cinchoneros Liberation movement, now with significant Soviet backing, gained the upper hand when several Army and Air Force units turned to their cause. The televised execution of 37 American soldiers caused world outrage but was quickly eclipsed by events in Europe and elsewhere. US retaliatory cruise missile strikes at rebel targets were followed by a raft of hostage taking incidents, piracy against civilian shipping and a general withdraw of the expatriate community. The success of the widely-anticipated coup in May of 91 was a forgone conclusion, with the former President and family already living at their palatial residence near Portland Oregon. </p> <p> Following the coups in Honduras and Nicaragua, a militaristic anti-American movement gained momentum and these new governments started rearming with cast-off Algerian and Libyan equipment (as these two countries rearm themselves, mostly with Polish and former East German equipment - see Mediterranean Fury) aided by Soviet deception, training, transport and financial resources. </p> <p> An attempted coup in Guatemala failed due to US clandestine activities, but there remains a solid anti-Western sentiment, including significant numbers of displaced jungle fighters who have now taken on the cause of freeing Belize of British rule. Costa Rica has remained stable as has Panama, although attempts in both countries to overthrow western supporting governments have been made, but failed miserably. The El Salvadoran Civil war rages on with both the US backed government and the FNLN precipitating atrocities which get more shocking every year. </p> <p> <img src="assets/images/caribbean/image003.jpg" style="max-width:320px;float:right;margin:12px;"> Colombia has remained staunchly pro-western, and billions of US dollars ensure they remain so. The leftist guerrilla movements that started in the 60‘s, primarily FARC but others also, have gained strength but are relatively well contained. The drug cartels, however, have significant and expanding power, outspending the government on technology and now using safe havens in Honduras and Nicaragua to ease their transport risk. </p> <p> Mexico is showing signs of emerging out of economic and political distress. It is relying heavily on the newly signed North American Free Trade Agreement and the population are expecting great things. So is the world, with the evolving revolt in the Chiapas region causing new concern! From a military standpoint, with only 12 F-5s and Gearing class destroyers, any major conflict domestic or otherwise will undoubtedly draw the US in to stabilize or protect its neighbor. Rebellion is in the wings should NAFTA fail to improve the Mexican economy. </p> <p> Venezuela entered a new phase in its history with Hugo Chavez seizing power during his 2nd Coup attempt in 1992 and the death of President Perez while en route to his impeachment hearings. Sitting on vast oil reserves and solidly linking itself to the new Soviet Government, Venezuela is quickly evolving as a regional power. By exerting political and financial energy and at times the threat of military involvement, neighboring countries are falling into line with Chavez‘s vision of a resurgent Caribbean trading block to control international trade into the Central and South American region. Local U.S., British, Spanish, Dutch, French and other interests have all been negatively affected. </p> <p> <img src="assets/images/caribbean/image004.jpg" style="max-width:320px;float:left;margin:12px;"> US efforts in Haiti and the continuing support of the Dominican Republic continue along historical lines, as does the evolution of the Eastern Caribbean islands. </p> <p> Cuba, as always is the most interesting of the Caribbean countries. With a resurgence of Soviet interest the Cuban military and air force in particular has been experiencing a period of revival not seen since the late 50‘s. It is suspected that most of the older SAM systems have been replaced by newer and much more capable ones, probably SA-10‘s, and that the older MiG 17‘s &amp; 21‘s have been replaced by MiG-23‘s and 29‘s. It is rumoured that a Kilo class submarine is now on the inventory. Two weeks ago, three RORO ships unloaded under cover of darkness, heavy security and some obvious deception measures. All of this was monitored by U.S. security agencies but it is unclear what was unloaded. Indications are that it was not missiles, but probably aircraft, munitions and support equipment of various types. </p> <p> <b>Security Assessments</b>: The chart below should assist in understanding the status of the many Caribbean and Central American countries and their key equipment. </p> <table><thead><tr><td>Country</td><td>Leaning</td><td>Concerns</td><td>Air Force</td><td>Naval Force</td><td>Land Force</td><td>Dependency</td></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Cuba</td><td>Soviet</td><td>Aggressive</td><td>12x MiG-29<br>60x MiG-23<br>48x MiG-21<br>ASW, MPA, EW<br>Multiple SAM Bdes</td><td>3x Koni FF<br>2x Grisha FFL<br>3 Tarantul FFL<br>18-20x OSA II FAC<br>12-15x Ptl Boats<br>2-3x Foxtrot SS<br>?1x Kilo SS?</td><td>140K:<br>3 Armd Div<br>3 Mech Div<br>12 Inf Div<br>1 Arty Div<br>AbBn Bde</td><td>USSR</td></tr> <tr><td>Nicaragua</td><td>Soviet</td><td>Re-arming</td><td>24x MiG-23BN<br>24x MiG-21bis<br>12x Mirage 5D<br>12x Mirage 5DE</td><td>Patrol craft</td><td>80K, COIN</td><td>Libya</td></tr> <tr><td>Honduras</td><td>Soviet</td><td>Re-arming</td><td>12x MiG-23B<br>12x F-5F<br>10x A-37B</td><td>Patrol craft</td><td>50K, COIN</td><td>USSR</td></tr> <tr><td>Venezuela</td><td>N/A</td><td>Independent</td><td>23x F16 Bl 15<br>36x Mirage<br>12x F-5<br>12x AT-27<br>6x Mig-25</td><td>6x Lupo FF<br>6+ patrol craft<br>Several Amphibious ships</td><td>130K:<br>3 Inf Div<br>1 Armd Div<br>1 Jungle Div<br>1 Cavalry Div</td><td>Independent</td></tr> <tr><td>El Salvador</td><td>Divided</td><td>Civil War</td><td>20-30x A-37<br>12x UH-1</td><td>3 patrol craft</td><td>14K, COIN</td><td>Govt - US<br>Rebels - Cuba</td></tr> <tr><td>Mexico</td><td>Western</td><td>Economic</td><td>12x F-5</td><td>2x Ex Gearing DD<br>2x Ex Bronstein FF</td><td>70K, 7x Bdes</td><td>US</td></tr> <tr><td>Haiti</td><td>Western</td><td>Insurrection Mil dissolved in 1995</td><td>Util, Tg</td><td>None</td><td>Internal security</td><td>US/UN</td></tr> <tr><td>Guatemala</td><td>Western</td><td>Insurgency</td><td>None</td><td>Patrol craft</td><td>39K, COIN</td><td>US</td></tr> <tr><td>Belize</td><td>Western</td><td>Insurgency</td><td>Tpt/Trg</td><td>None</td><td>1.5K, 3x Bn</td><td>UK</td></tr> <tr><td>Costa Rica</td><td>Western</td><td>Insurgency</td><td>Utility</td><td>None</td><td>Para Mil guard</td><td>US</td></tr> <tr><td>Panama</td><td>Western</td><td>Insurgency</td><td>Utility/Trg</td><td>None</td><td>Para Mil guard</td><td>US</td></tr> <tr><td>Columbia</td><td>Western</td><td>Drugs/insurg</td><td>16x A-37<br>12x Kfir C2<br>Recon, EW, MPA, Tanker, Tpt, Trg, Util</td><td>4x Padilla FFL<br>1x Dealey DE<br>2x Type 209 SS<br>2x CG Cutters<br>Patrol craft</td><td>250K, 8x Div</td><td>US</td></tr> <tr><td>Aruba, Bonair, Curacao (ABC)</td><td>Western</td><td>Proximity to Venezuela</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>Netherlands</td></tr> <tr><td>Trinidad &amp;

    '<h3>Northern Fury Background and Scenarios</h3> <p>The Northern Fury scenarios follow a campaign from the initial Soviet onslaught through Norway and the North Atlantic all the way to the conclusion of the war. This campaign is the genesis of the alternate history created by Northern Fury and is the central theme running through the story.</p> <p>The scenarios, fifty eight (58) in total, depict the epic struggle of a resurgent Soviet fleet attempting to strangle NATO and force a favorable situation for resolution at the bargaining table. The USSR feels, and is in fact being, strangled by the west. Their real objective is a Europe without NATO, and with the US no longer having control over potential trading partners in a region tired of a century of warfare, hot and cold.</p> <p>The scope and scale of the confrontation provide little or no room for the political wrangling and double-speak we in the real world have become so accustomed to in the past 25 years. A ‘coalition of the willing‘ is generally not needed in a global war of survival. NATO‘s search for a new reason to exit is obviously no longer in question and nations respond to General Defense Plans (GDP) long practiced and still remembered by governments and militaries steeped in Cold War experience.</p> <p>NATO however, is caught ‘flat-footed‘ by the surprise Soviet attack, its forces are out of place, and some are out of date. Some nations realized as early as 1990 that the ‘Peace Dividend‘ was a phantom dream of the optimistic elements of society, others did not. The gradual increase in tension, proliferation of older weapons systems, political turmoil in the third world and outright hostility of the hard line Soviet regimes policies did eventually convince all that the Cold war was getting colder. By the winter of 1993/94 even the most reluctant were once again looking over their war stocks, some in horror at how quickly equipment and training succumb to the atrophy of neglect. </p> <p>This is genuinely a conflict at the cusp of technological revolution. Digital warfare is in its infancy, many nations are using Viet Nam era equipment while some cutting edge technologies are making their first appearance. The play of these scenarios shows advantages and the disadvantages of these high tech systems, precise and deadly but rare and tricky to use. Juxtaposed with the mass of 60‘s era dumb bombs and dead reckoning, combining the new and the old provides the player with some very interesting results. The technology gap is not all one-sided, the USSR has invested heavily in new technology, so whether it is F-4 Phantoms going up against Su-27‘s or F-15‘s meeting MiG-21‘s the clash of layered technology gaps makes the battle challenging.</p> <p>When tackling a campaign of this magnitude it quickly becomes apparent that two things rule the flow of conflict far more than any other factor: Logistics and time. Every attempt has been made to limit both sides to the physical reality of these two factors, munitions are limited, fuel for both ships and aircraft must be provided, numbers and availability of resources are tacked. Benefit of the doubt has been granted to logistics staff of both sides who would be making super-human efforts to keep things working, but limits of speed and capacity rule some key decisions made by in the design and hoisted onto the player. I hope that this adds a context of reality and an enriched experience for the gamer who follows this story from scenario to scenario.</p> <p>Some of these scenarios are playable by both sides but most are NATO only, as that truly shows the desperation of the situation from the viewpoint of the defender. Although the campaign is designed to be played sequentially, this could be daunting as some of the earlier scenarios are also some of the most challenging. I recommend that you are reasonably familiar with the mechanics of COMMAND before attempting the first two scenarios, but many of the others are quite manageable to the novice player. Linkages with several other campaigns become evident through this series; Mediterranean Fury is raging but strategic decisions by NATO provide more resources for Northern Fury. Caribbean Fury is an initial distraction for the US, UK, the Netherlands and France but once the situation there appears to calm down, more assets are forthcoming. The events in Baltic Fury become a major threat to the success of this campaign, causing some critical timing decisions that the player is forced to live with. Even the far off campaigns in Indian Ocean and Pacific Fury, have an impact on the player.

    '<p> The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (<a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/index.htm" target="_blank">NATO</a>) was formed on 4 April 1949, as a Military/Political body to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact (WP)countries. The basis of the alliance is the collective defence codified in <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/topics_110496.htm" target="_blank">Article Five</a> of the treaty which states: <i>"...that an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies." </i> </p><p> The 12 founding members of NATO are: </p><ul> <li>Belgium,</li> <li>Canada, </li> <li>Denmark,</li> <li>France, (Withdrew from NATO‘s integrated military command in 1966, rejoined 1994.)</li> <li>Iceland, </li> <li>Italy, </li> <li>Luxembourg, </li> <li>the Netherlands, </li> <li>Norway, </li> <li>Portugal, </li> <li>the United Kingdom, and </li> <li>the United States.</li> </ul><p></p> <p> The following countries joined NATO between its foundation and the start of Northern Fury in 1994: </p><ul> <li>Greece (1952)</li> <li>Turkey (1952)</li> <li>West Germany (1955)</li> <li>Spain (1982)</li> </ul> <p></p><p> The reunification of Germany in 1990, meant that the former East Germany was drawn into NATO. Between 1989 and 1994 the reunification of Germany became a major friction point between NATO and western European countries and a resurgent Soviet Union. </p><p> Collectively this force - in Europe alone - amounted to over 3.7 million soldiers, sailors and airmen under arms, tens of thousands of armoured vehicles, thousands of aircraft and hundreds of ships. A formidable force. Command of this force, with 16 governments and defence ministries involved however can be complex, not to mention the scale of the geography and diversity of capabilities. At the top of the Command Structure is a political body - the North Atlantic Council (NAC) which oversaw the military element of the Alliance on behalf of the member nations. Next in line was the NATO Military Committee (NMC), which issued broad policy, interfaced with the NAC and had direct communications with each nations Ministry of Defence (or equivalent). While the NAC and NMC dealt with issues at the Strategic level, operational planning and execution of warfighting tasks was conducted by three commanders: Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) commanding all forces in Europe (Allied Command Europe); Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) commanding all forces in the Atlantic (Allied Command Atlantic); and Commander-in-Chief Allied Command Channel (CINCCHAN). The remainder of the operational portion of the NATO command structure is depicted on the chart below: </p> <img src="images/nato/image001.png"> <p> On the tactical level were dozens of Corps, Air Forces and Fleets, however clear distinction below the level depicted becomes complex because many of the commanders were ‘double hatted‘ meaning the Commander had two roles. For instance, SACLANT was also Commander US 2nd Fleet, and Commander NATO Strike Fleet Atlantic (STRIKFLEETLANT). Another example is that CINCCHAN, was not a ‘Supreme‘ Commander as the other two (SACEUR &amp; SACLANT) but he was Commander in Chief FLEET (British Royal Navy) and Commander in Chief Eastern Atlantic Area, under SACLANT. </p><p> Instead of digging into the detail of NATO‘s tactical structures, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_NATO#Structure_in_1989" target="_blank">this Wiki page</a> provides a good summary in the section ‘Structure in 1989‘. </p>'

    '<p> The United States Navy has been the undisputed naval powerhouse since the Second World War. Not only is it the only Navy to have global reach and power projection with multiple Supper Carriers, but its submarine fleet is arguably unrivalled, except perhaps but the USSR. </p> <figure> <img src="images/USN cover_files/image001.jpg"> <figcaption>Battle Group Z during the Persian Gulf War</figcaption> </figure><br> <p> Historically 600 Ship Navy, with the warming of relations between East and West, congress started to reduce funding of new ships and demand retirement of older ships.

Some of the key areas where Northern Fury strays from the historic are: </p><ul> <img src="images/USN cover_files/image003.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <li>The aircraft carrier (CV) USS Ranger (CV-61) was not decommissioned but instead, held in San Diego with reduced crew and no air group as ready reserve. She will be retired when USS John C. Stennis (CGN-74) is commissioned later in 1994 or early 1995.</li> <li>The USS Forrestal (CV-59) was retained as an air group training carrier.</li> <li>USS Enterprise (CVN-65) completed an accelerated overhaul 8 months early</li> <li>All of the Iowa class battleships (BBs) were retained in service</li> <img src="images/USN cover_files/image004.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <li>All nuclear powered guided missile cruisers (CGN) were retained. This represents a total of nine ships: 4 x Virginia class, 2 x California class, and the Long Beach, Bainbridge &amp; Truxton.</li> <li>All Belknap &amp; Leahy class CGs were retained (nine of each) with the NTU (New Threat Upgrades) complete. Combined, the additional 27 CG/CGNs means that a third CG/CGN can deploy with most Carrier Battle Groups (CVBG) as well as act as Flag for smaller Task Groups (TG).</li> <img src="images/USN cover_files/image005.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <li>Four of 29 Seawolf Class fleet attack submarines (SSN) have been completed with 3-5 commissioning per year. The Virginia Class has not been designed or considered as it was built as a stop gap when the Seawolf class was canceled. Of all measures taken, this was the most controversial due to the cost of the Seawolf, and the proposals for the Virginia class are quite promising.</li> <li>28 Sturgeon class plus the 9 long hull (Archerfish) Class, the Narwhal and 3x Permit class SSNs were retained. The Permit‘s followed by the Sturgeons will decommission as the Seawolf class comes on line. A stable fleet size of 100 fleet attack boats and 9-10 special mission boats will be maintained.</li> <img src="images/USN cover_files/image006.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <li>Seven Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers (DDG), called the DDG-51 class have been completed with 5-6 per year planned to the culminate at 62 units.</li> <li>Because of the urgent need for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) escorts, the shortage of dry-dock space and the increased number of Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) carrying ships; the last 7 of 31 Spruance class destroyers (DD) will not be upgraded to carry the Vertical Launch missile System (VLS) but will remain ASW DDs and undergo shorter mid-life refits than the other 24 ships. The 4 Kidd Class DDGs received their NTU in the late 80‘s and will serve another 20 years.</li> <li>The Farragut Class DDGs have been retained, 6x NTU refits have been completed, all based on the East Coast, with the remaining four completing later in 1994.</li> <img src="images/USN cover_files/image007.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <li>Only three Charles F. Adams NTU DDGs are ready but another 12 are undergoing refit which will be completed in the next 18 months. Both of the older DDG classes (Farragut and Charles F. Adams) will serve until ~2000 when enough of the Arleigh Burke‘s are available to relieve them.</li> <li>The 51 unit Oliver Hazard Perry (OHP) Class Guided Missile Frigate (FFG) had completed commissioning in 89 with no replacement on the horizon. The Navy pointed out this gap to Congress and a further 12 were ordered in 91 with the first four already launched and due to commission later in 1994. As a stop-gap four Brooke Class FFG‘s (FFG-3-6) were retained, but will decommission later this year. A ‘Follow on Frigate‘ program is underway with a bid for 72 units, the first being laid down in early 95 and will replace both the OHP and the Knox Class in the escort role. The OHP will average 30 years of service when decommissioned.</li> <img src="images/USN cover_files/image008.jpg" style="margin:12px;"> <li>36 of the 46 ship Knox class Frigates (FF) remain in service, the remaining 10 are mothballed. The problem plagued design will be replaced by the ‘Follow on Frigate‘ program on a 2 for 1 basis starting in 1996 with most only serving 25-27 years. (Historic real life service was only 23 years).</li> <img src="images/USN cover_files/image009.jpg" style="margin:12px;"> </ul> <p></p> <p> Graphically the comparison between the historic goal and the Northern Fury programme looks like this: </p> <td<b>&gt;Total Other</td<b><table class="compare"> <thead> <tr><td colspan="8" align="center">USN Fleet size - Northern Fury Campaign vs 600 Ship Plan</td> </tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td> </td><td colspan="2"><b>Historic</b></td><td colspan="5"><b>Northern Fury</b></td></tr>	<tr><td></td><td>1985</td><td>Goal</td><td>Ready</td><td>Reserve</td><td>Launching</td><td>Total</td><td>Notes</td></tr> <tr><td>CV/CVN	</td><td>13	</td><td>15	</td><td>13	</td><td>2	</td><td>	1	</td><td>16	</td><td>CV-61 to retire when CVN-74 commissions </td></tr> <tr><td>BB	</td><td>2	</td><td>4	</td><td>	4	</td><td> </td><td>	</td><td>4	</td><td> </td></tr> <tr><td>CG/CGN	</td><td rowspan="2">98	</td><td rowspan="2">137</td><td>	54	</td><td> </td><td>	</td><td>54	</td><td>Total of 124, DDG-51s coming online, older CG/CGNs to retire over time</td></tr> <tr><td>DD/DDG	</td><td>67	</td><td>	3	</td><td>70	</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr> <tr><td>FF/FFG	</td><td>108 </td><td>101</td><td>	90	</td><td>11	</td><td>4	</td><td>105</td><td>	First 4 of 12 new OHPs arrives, Brooks to retire </td></tr> <tr><td>SSN	</td><td>98	</td><td>100</td><td>	100	</td><td> </td><td>	</td><td>100</td><td>	</td></tr> <tr><td>SSN/Sp	</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>	9	</td><td> </td><td>	</td><td>9 </td><td>Special purpose, mostly SOF delivery </td></tr> <tr><td>Small	</td><td>6	</td><td>0	</td><td>	0	</td><td>6	</td><td>	</td><td>6	</td><td>	Pegasus Class FAC </td></tr> <tr><td><b>Total Combat</b></td><td>325	</td><td>357</td><td>	337	</td><td>19	</td><td>8	</td><td>364</td><td>	</td></tr> <tr><td>Amphib	</td><td>62	</td><td>75	</td><td>70	</td><td> </td><td></td><td> 70	</td><td></td></tr> <tr><td>Mine Warfare	</td><td>3	</td><td>31	</td><td>30	</td><td>10</td><td></td><td>	40	</td><td></td></tr> <tr><td>Replen	</td><td>53	</td><td>69	</td><td>58	</td><td> </td><td></td><td> 58	</td><td></td></tr> <tr><td>Mat Support	</td><td>25	</td><td>27	</td><td>26	</td><td> </td><td></td><td> 26	</td><td></td></tr> <tr><td>Fleet Support	</td><td>29 </td><td>33	</td><td>29	</td><td> </td><td></td><td> 29	</td><td></td></tr> <tr><td>172	</td><td>235	</td><td>213	</td><td> </td><td></td><td> 223	</td><td></td></tr> <tr><td>SSBN	</td><td>37	</td><td>36	</td><td>36	</td><td>10	</td><td> </td><td>36	</td><td></td></tr> <tr><td><b>Total All</b></td><td>534 </td><td>628	</td><td>586	</td><td>29	</td><td>8	</td><td>623	</td><td></td></tr> </tbody></table> <img src="images/USN cover_files/image010.jpg" style="margin:12px;">'

    '<p> The United States Air Force (USAF) in 1994 had historically been reduced by 30% from a 1986 strength of around 608,000 to 426,000 and was shrinking rapidly. In Northern Fury, due to increased tensions in Europe and around the globe, the strength is reduced from the mid ‘80s but by a much smaller margin. The Northern Fury USAF has about 600,000 personnel in 1994 and this number has been stable for the past two years. Many of the changes implemented by the various BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure Commission) reviews (1988, 1991, 1993) do not occur, realignment where it was reasonable happened but most bases remain open, specifics are noted where it makes a difference. Structurally the changes that occurred historically remain extant because they made sense in an evolving world. The fundamental structure of the USAF looks like this: </p> <img src="images/The United States Air Force/image001.png"> <p> <b>Air Combat Command</b>: Air Combat Command (ACC), headquartered at Langley AFB, Virginia, is the primary provider of combat air forces to reinforce regional commands around the globe or to defend North America. ACC‘s main focus is the training and preparation of combat ready fighter, bomber, reconnaissance, rescue and Battle management forces for rapid deployment or employment. This is a large command with over 230,000 regular and reserve personnel and over 1,000 aircraft. </p> <img src="images/The United States Air Force/image002.png"> <p> <b>Air Mobility Command</b>: Air Mobility Command (AMC) is another very large command which provides the USAF and the US Armed Forces as a whole with global rapid deployment options. This command is constantly busy performing air lift, air refueling, aeromedical evacuations and many other minor tasks every day of the year. With 125,000 personnel and about 925 airframes, this is the second largest command in the Air Force. </p> <img src="images/The United States Air Force/image003.png"> <p> <b>Pacific Air Forces</b>: Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) are the USAF‘s forward deployed combat and support elements in the Pacific theatre. Although relatively small with 46,000 personnel and about 330 aircraft, this still represents a significant force in the region, over 260 of the aircraft being front line combat types. One of the major tasks performed by PACAF, besides deterrence, is to train with Asian and Australian Air Forces as a way of leveraging the combat power of those nations toward a unified command system. </p> <img src="images/The United States Air Force/image004.png"> <p> <b>US Air Force in Europe</b>: US Air Force in Europe (USAFE) with its HQ at Ramstein, Germany, supplies forces to Allied Command Europe (ACE) through dedicated air wings under the control of the various NATO Air Forces. 2 and 4 Allied Tactical Air Force (ATAF) in northern Europe are both under the command of Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AIRCENT), essentially USAFE HQ under a different name. For forces allocated to southern Europe, primarily 16th US Air Force, NATO‘s 5 and 6 ATAF will control operations under the direction of Allied Air Forces Southern Europe (AIRSOUTH) located at Naples Italy. </p> <p> Unsurprisingly, the most significant impact of Northern Fury‘s changes occur in Europe. Historically, after ‘Peace Dividend‘ reductions, only eight Fighter Squadrons in three wings remained in Europe with about 175 front line combat aircraft. In Northern Fury, there are 12 Fighter Wings remaining in Europe, with 28 Squadrons and another 8 are on immediate recall from the Continental US (CONUS). This totals up as 860 front line aircraft and between 50 and 100 tankers, transport and reconnaissance aircraft in support. USAFE will grow well beyond this as the well-practiced flyover reinforcement program continues, swelling to more than double this number. </p> <img src="images/The United States Air Force/image005.png"> <img src="images/The United States Air Force/image006.png"> <p> <b>Air Force Special Operation Command</b>: Based at Hurlburt Field, Florida, the Air Force Special Operation Command (AFSOC) only became a separate command in May of 1990 when the former 23rd Air Force was re-designated to this role. AFSOC has a wide ranging list of tasks including: </p><ul> <li>Providing combat controllers for air to ground coordination of airpower. This function is being consolidated within AFSOC from ACC, PACAF and USAFE but the capacity remains in those commands</li> <li>Providing Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) services worldwide</li> <li>Operating all airborne weather services for US Army and USAF worldwide, as well as providing aircraft to NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) which includes the US National Weather Service.</li> <li>Operating airborne psychological operations platforms.</li> <li>Operating a squadron of AC-130 Spectre gunships for close air support</li> <li>Operating a fleet of ‘Combat Talon‘ C-130 special mission aircraft for stealthy infiltration of special forces personnel.</li> <li>Operating a fleet of ‘Combat Shadow‘ C-130 special mission refueling aircraft.</li> <li>Operating a fleet of ‘Pave Low‘ and ‘Pave Hawk‘ helicopters for CSAR, insertion and extraction missions.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p> AFSOC is a small, agile organization which runs its own school, test and evaluation unit and deployable Command and Control elements. Operating a fleet of over 100 special mission C-130s, 36 MH-53 heavy lift helicopters and several MH-60‘s, this force can deploy elements globally either as individual aircraft or as mission tailored groups on very short notice. </p> <img src="images/The United States Air Force/image007.png"> <p> <b>Air Force Space Command</b>: Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is another new command, it was established in 1982 to control all US military satellites, launch vehicles, space tracking and ballistic missile warning systems. The role of AFSPC increased substantially in 1993 when it inherited responsibility for all Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM) from the defunct Strategic Air Command (SAC). Additionally, the commander of AFSC is also the commander of the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), the bi-lateral command between the US and Canada for defending North American airspace from intrusion. This relatively small command has about 39,000 personnel, half of them civilian, but is located in over 80 locations around the world. Two numbered Air Forces in the command coordinate and control 580 ICBMs and over 50 communications, GPS, reconnaissance, ballistic missile warning and weather satellites. </p> <img src="images/The United States Air Force/image008.png"> <p> <b>Air Force Reserve</b>: In 1994, the Air Force Reserve (AFR) is an agency within the Air Force, it does not become a command until 1997. As an element with 80,000 personnel and nearly 500 aircraft however, the Reserve is a major component of the USAF. Many of the wings and squadrons of the AFR are ‘associated‘ with regular USAF wings and squadrons, primarily in AMC where the aircrew often share aircraft or combine regular and reserve on the same crew. Within the AFR structure there are three numbered Air Forces, 37 wings, 128 groups and about 400 squadrons (many without aircraft). There are some minor changes due to the Northern Fury setting but nothing significant. Not all detail is shown in the diagram below: </p> <img src="images/The United States Air Force/image009.png"> <p> <b>Air Force National Guard</b>: Commonly referred to simply as the ‘Air Guard‘ or simply the ‘Guard‘ this is another large element of the USAF with over 111,000 personnel flying in 88 wings from every state of the country. The Air Guard provides trained units and people directly to the other commands. Unlike the ARS, these units belong to the State Governors until federalized for operations. Standing agreements exist for NORAD and many other domestic activities, but special permissions are needed to deploy Air Guard units overseas. No numbered Air Forces are operated by the Air Guard and many wings consist of only one squadron. Northern Fury has some significant changes that impact this element, primarily because the active air force maintains many squadrons that were historically deactivated. By 1994 the Air Guard was receiving a significant number of very new aircraft as regular units closed down, but since that does not happen, the Guard was maintaining many older aircraft until production of newer airframes could catch up to demand. The Air Guard flies over 1,500 aircraft in 109 squadrons as follows: </p><ul> <li>7x F-15A Squadrons of 24 aircraft each, 3 are for NORAD, one is in Hawaii;</li> <li>29x F-16ADF Squadrons of 18 aircraft each, 14 are for NORAD;</li> <li>3x F-16 Block 25 Squadrons of 24 aircraft each;</li> <li>1x F-16 Block 50 Squadron of 24 aircraft, half of that Squadron is in the Persian Gulf;</li> <li>3x F-4E Squadrons of 24 aircraft each;</li> <li>1x F-4G ‘Wild Weasel‘ Squadron of 24 aircraft;</li> <li>2x RF-4C ‘Reconnaissance‘ Squadrons of 18 aircraft each;</li> <li>3x A7D Squadrons of 18 aircraft each;</li> <li>5x A-10 Squadrons of 18 aircraft each;</li> <li>1x EC-130E ‘Commando Solo‘ Squadron of 8 aircraft;</li> <li>19x C-130E/H varying between 8 and 12 aircraft each (1 Sqn is forming and has 5);</li> <li>2x C-141B Squadrons of 8 aircraft each;</li> <li>1x C-5A Squadron of 8 aircraft;</li> <li>1x CT-43A Squadron of 6 aircraft working with ATEC; </li> <li>1x C-21A Squadron with 4 aircraft for VIP transport;</li> <li>20x KC-135 Squadrons with 7 to 10 aircraft each;</li> <li>1x T-38 Squadron with around 32 aircraft working for ATEC;</li> <li>1x C-130E Training Squadron with 10 aircraft working for ATEC; </li> <li>1x F-4G/RF-4C Training Squadron with at least 12 of each working for ATEC;</li> <li>2x C-130P Rescue Squadrons with 5 aircraft each</li> <li>2x HH-60 Rescue Squadrons with 8 aircraft each</li> <li>1x Mixed Rescue Squadron with 4x C-130P and 6x HH-60.</li> <li>2x Rescue Jumper Squadrons.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p> <b>Air Force Training and Education Command</b>: The Training Command (ATEC) is worth noting simply because of the scale at which the USAF conducts training. At any time, there are over 60,000 assigned personnel and around 350,000 students within the command. Although flight training is only one of many functions of ATEC, it operates over 1,500 aircraft in two numbers air forces, including over 350 front line aircraft! </p> <img src="images/The United States Air Force/image010.png"> <p> <b>Air Force Materiel Command</b>: Procurement, life cycle management, testing and evaluation as well as routine logistic support is the role of the AFMC. With over 115,000 personnel and operating 40 different types of aircraft, this is a large command. AFMC also operates the ‘Test Pilot‘ school and works with industry to develop and evolve aircraft. </p> <p> <b>Northern Fury</b>: With the significant increase of tensions in Europe caused by the Northern Fury storyline, US lawmakers and hawks amongst the defense community watched a resurgence of hard liners with a mix of caution and anger. Increased Soviet aggressiveness as early as 1989 and then the 1991 coup that deposed Gorbachev signaled a change in the path of history. Tensions rapidly ramped up as the Soviet Union exerted pressure on Poland and Germany with the apparent goal of minimalizing NATO‘s and ultimately the United States‘ influence on Europe. As a reaction to these developments the US Government embarked on a program to rejuvenate the Reagan era programs of the 1980‘s. Three major initiatives were undertaken to stem the decline of combat power within the air force: </p><ol type="1"> <li>As mentioned earlier, halting the base and wing closures recommended by the various BRAC committees allowed the structure of the USAF to remain relatively unchanged, from the late ‘80s.</li> <li>In order to maintain force levels, several airframes were retained in service longer than they were historically. A major impact of this was on the Air Guard, as they did not receive the windfall of new equipment in the early ‘90s. Several squadrons still fly F-4 Phantom and A-7 Corsairs, and many more retained the legacy F-16ADF (Air Defense Variant). There is a smattering of other airframes that will be retained longer than planned such as the F-4G Wild Wesel, the F-111F and B-52G, these will be mentioned in the detailed aircraft section later.</li> <li>Ramping up, or more accurately, not ramping down of production. Although there are some specialty aircraft that this policy affects such as the EC/MC/AC-130 series where Northern Fury sees about 27 more airframes in use, the big impact is in front line fighter aircraft and the B-2 Bomber. <ol type="a">	<li>A total of eight B-2 Spirit bombers are in service (AV-7 to AV-12, plus AV-5 &amp; 6 held by ATEC). These have formed the 393rd Bomb Squadron at Whiteman AFB. Training, testing and evaluation is ongoing with the two ATEC airframes not ready for immediate operations.</li> <li>The F-15E Strike Eagle, all 200 ordered plus 6 replacement aircraft had been delivered by early 1992, a further order was placed for 100 airframes early enough to continue production at capacity (42/year) until 1993. Therefore, an additional three squadrons are available and the 6th Fighter Wing at Mountain Home AFB was formed. 550th Fighter Squadron, the operational conversion unit for this type is due to deactivate later in 1994, but remains extant within ATEC when Northern Fury commences. </li> <li>The single largest impact of retained production is the F-16 Falcon. Historically the late ‘80s and early ‘90s saw a massive downsizing and sell-off of this ubiquitous and versatile fighter. Many went to the Air Guard, many others went into long term preservation and yet more were sold to allies. In Northern Fury the 1988 level of production (180/year) was maintained right through 1993 and is planned to continue for at least 3 more years. Factoring in a slightly higher level of attrition, this production results in an additional 442 airframes being available, all at the Block 40/42 and 50/52 standard. Combined with retaining some older aircraft in the Air Guard, not retiring many F-16ADF, and canceling several foreign sales a net increase of 15x F-16 Squadrons are available to USAF.</li> </ol></li></ol>'

    "US_army",
    '<p> The United States Army is a large and powerful force, technologically advanced, generally well trained, and at a relatively high state of readiness. The 1980‘s was a decade of change for the US Army. Coming out of the Viet Nam era, the new professional (vice conscript) force adopted new organizations, new training methods, new equipment, new tactics and overall a completely new concept of integration of combat power. The US Army of 1994 had been tested during Operation Desert Shield/Storm in Iraq and, although there was some improvement to make, proved to a great extent that the reforms had worked beyond the imagination of most. </p><p> The US Army in Europe through the latter part of the Cold war was the focus of the entire army structure. Led by 7th Army HQ, two full Corps (V &amp; VII) were largely stationed in Germany with a third Corps (III Corps) based in the US but having pre-positioned equipment holdings in POMCUS (Prepositioning Of Materiel Configured in Unit Sets) sites. Although problematic due to maintenance, cost, security and standardization, this system was exercised rigorously in the annual REFORGER (REturn of FORces to GERmany) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Reforger" target="_blank">Exercises</a>. By 1989 the POMCUS system was set up to rapidly deploy six divisions, support elements and logistics to Germany, within 10 days, to reinforce the four divisions permanently stationed there. Historically this system came to a sudden end following the Gulf War, when VII Corps and over half of the forces in Germany were repatriated and rapidly deactivated. </p><p> In the Northern Fury world the US Army has experienced some difficulty obtaining consistent and clear government direction since the fall of the Berlin wall. The massive effort in the Gulf War was supposed to be the closing act to the Germany based VII Corps which, due to budgetary pressure to reduce spending, was due to deactivate in the early ‘90s. The increased tension from a resurgent Soviet Union has interrupted that plan mid stride - inconvenient for both military and budgetary planners. The end result is that some repatriation has occurred but some plans were canceled and others modified. The main points of impact are: </p><ul> <li>7th US Army HQ remains in Europe (double hatted as CENTAG HQ)</li> <li>The 18 Division structure established by the Reagan administration remains, therefore <ul> <li>2nd Armored Division is not deactivated (planned for 1995)</li> <li>3rd Armored Division is not deactivated (in 1992)</li> <li>5th Infantry Division (Mech) is not deactivated (in 1992)</li> <li>6th Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated (reduced to one Bde in 94, removed 98)</li> <li>7th Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated (in 1994)</li> <li>8th Infantry Division (Mech) is not deactivated (in 1992)</li> <li>9th Infantry Division (Light) is not deactivated (in 1991)</li> <li>Additionally all National Guard and Army Reserve ‘Training‘ Divisions remain extant</li> </ul></li> <li>VII US Corps HQ remains in Europe but with a reduced staff and structure: <ul> <li>1st Armored Division moved to the US with 3rd Brigade remaining in Germany</li> <li>3rd Infantry Division moved to the US with 3rd Brigade remaining in Germany</li> <li>77nd and 210th Artillery Brigades moved to the US with a POMCUS site in Germany</li> <li>7th Combat Engineer Brigade is transferred from VII Corps to 7th Army</li> <li>197th Infantry Brigade (REFORGER) is transferred to 7th Army as CENTAG reserve</li> <li>207th Military Intelligence Brigade is transferred to 7th Army for general support</li> </ul></li> <li>The ‘Berlin‘ Brigade is due to deactivate in July of 1994.</li> <li>56th Artillery Brigade, has exchanged its deactivated Pershing missile systems for M270 MLRS armed with MGM-140 ATacMS (Army Tactical Missile System) and remains a direct reporting unit to 7th Army HQ.</li> <li>The POMCUS program was expanded to include six more Brigade size sets of equipment; 2 for 1st Armored Division, 2 for 3rd Infantry Division, and 2 for the two artillery brigades.</li> <li>In order to maintain enhanced security in Kuwait, 187th Infantry Brigade Army Reserve has been activated. This is a unique structure as Battlegroup size elements from the standing army, National Guard and Reserve rotated through this Bde on an 8 month tour of duty. While in Kuwait they undergo a rigorous training program to enhance their combat capability.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p> It should also be noted that divisions based solely in the continental US (CONUS) except 82nd Airborne and 101st Air Assault Divisions, only had two active brigades. The third brigade was either National Guard or Army Reserve and these, although equipped the same as the active units, would take a minimum of 30 days to deploy. </p> <p> During the turmoil of the post ‘Gulf War‘ moves manning in the Army remained relatively constant. Although there was an initial dip in strength due to planned downsizing in 91-92, it has largely been made up in 93. The strength as of Jan 1994 is slightly smaller than its recent peak in the late ‘80s but about 200,000 more than historic - totals of the US Army is: </p><ul> <li>Army: 755,000</li> <li>Army National Guard: 450,000</li> <li>Army Reserve: 582,000</li> </ul> <p></p> <p> <b>Structure</b>: Within the continental US (CONUS) there are six army level HQs (1st Army to 6th Army), these are primarily tasked a mobilization role in times of national crisis. They can be activated for operations such as 3rd Army in the Gulf war. The two active armies, 7th Army in Europe and 8th Army in Korea are on full operational status. Within CONUS all active duty units are assigned to Corps and most have a wartime deployment role. The Corps in CONUS are: </p> <p> <img src="images/United States Army/image001.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>I Corps</b>: This is a small Corps charged with experimentation and development, but also has emergency deployment tasks. It is likely that I Corp would deploy to US Army Pacific, probably with 7th Infantry Division (ID), along with its artillery, aviation and air defence brigades. 9th ID is a very unique formation; it is the testbed light wheeled vehicles and rapid ground mobility. This division was earmarked to deploy to Northern Germany or Denmark, however its lightly armored infantry ((HMMWV or Desert Patrol Vehicles), combined with only having two tanks battalions (in its National Guard round-out brigade) may have precluded its employment on that front. Its high speed cross country mobility, on the other hand made the unit ideal for desert operations. </p> <img src="images/United States Army/image002.png" style="margin:12px;"> <p> <b>III Corps</b>: The complete opposite of I Corps, this corps is a massive organization which is destined for Europe in its entirety. An initial glance at the organization is misleading however. III Corps, in addition to its own formations, is a holding organization for 7th Army in Europe. Divisions tasked with rapidly reinforcing both Europe based Corps through REFORGER are held under command of III Corps for training and administration while in CONUS, their parent Corps have operational command however. III Corps will deploy to northern Germany and operate as part of NORTHAG (British Army on the Rhine) while formations supporting V &amp; VII Corps will be under command of CENTAG (7th US Army). </p> <img src="images/United States Army/image003.png" style="margin:12px;"> <p> It is worth noting that the POMCUS policy was to move 6, now 8 divisions to Germany in less than 10 days: 1st Cav, 1st ID, 1st AD, 2nd AD, 3rd ID, 4th ID, 5th ID, 194th Armd Bde*, 197th Inf Bde*, 3 ACR, 212th FA Bde plus two more FA Bdes for Northern Fury. The last division (unless you count the three independent Bdes as a division) is 9th ID from I Corps, which would fly over in its entirety. The feasibility of all but the 9th ID deployment was well practiced, as discussed earlier, 9th ID was not well suited to the north German plain. (*From XVIII Airborne Corps below) </p> <p> <b>XVIII Airborne Corps</b>: Commonly referred to as ‘America‘s Contingency Corps‘ this organization has seen a lot of recent action and deployed to the Sini peninsula in 1982, Grenada in 1983, Panama in 1989 and the Gulf war in 1991. Similar to III Corps above, this formation is also charged with holding elements destined for Europe, but the main elements of the corps are its three rapid deployment divisions, each one unique. 82nd Airborne Division has a battalion task force on 24 hours notice to move anywhere on the globe, at all times, and the remainder of a brigade moving within 3 days. The 101st Air Assault Division maintains an aviation brigade with over 320 helicopters; more than most nations operate. 10th Mountain Division is capable of moving by air to anywhere in the world within 10 days. 10th Mountain has a National Guard round-out brigade but both of the other divisions are fully manned standing army units. </p> <img src="images/United States Army/image004.png" style="margin:12px;"> <p> <b>US Army Europe</b>: Commanded by 7th Army HQ, also acting as NATO CENTAG, these two Corps and supporting units have been the focal point of US Army training and development since the end of the Korean War. After the post-Gulf War reductions this force is at its lowest point in terms of manning since 1950, with only two fully manned divisions, six independent or forward positioned brigades and two armored cavalry regiments. Given 10 days to mobilize, 7th Army or CENTAG would be a powerful force indeed, with 10 American, 7 German, 3 French and one Canadian division at its disposal. Ten days is a long time in a modern conflict however. </p> <img src="images/United States Army/image005.png" style="margin:12px;"> <p> <b>US Army Pacific</b>: US Army Pacific is a diverse and dispersed organization. Commanded by Commander 8th Army with his HQ in South Korea and having forces in Alaska, Hawaii and Japan, this army relies very heavily on its allies and the USAF to add armor and firepower to the fight. </p> <img src="images/United States Army/image006.png" style="margin:12px;"> <p> <b>US Army South</b>: The 193rd Infantry Brigade is the only regular army unit in this command. The primary purpose of this brigade is security of the Panama Canal Zone, but it also assists the Panamanian Government and other US agencies in conducting counter insurgency and counter narcotics operations. </p> <img src="images/United States Army/image007.png" style="margin:12px;"> <p> <b>US Army Kuwait</b>: In the three years following the Gulf War, tensions in the region have increased, primarily because Iran has become increasingly hostile towards the West and Iraq. In all likelihood this resurgent hostility is linked to improved Iranian relations with the Soviet Union. Therefore, in order to maintain enhanced security in Kuwait, the 187th Infantry Brigade, Army Reserve has been activated. The brigade is a shining example of the ‘Total Force‘ concept within the US Army, the HQ, an infantry battalion, 5-5th Artillery Battalion HQ and one battery, Engineer Company and Cavalry Troop are from the Army Reserve. The regular army and the National Guard provide a battalion and an artillery battery each to the force. Each battalion rotates in for an 8-month tour of duty and mans in-place equipment, conducts an intensive training program and then returns home. The battalions rotate at 4 month intervals and routinely train with Kuwaiti and Saudi forces. </p> <img src="images/United States Army/image008.png" style="margin:12px;"> <p> <b>US Army Special Operations Command</b>: The US Army Special Operations Command (USA SOC) is a relatively new organization, formed in 1989 when all Special Forces were place under the control of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). This force, trains, equips, maintains and deploys Special Forces elements worldwide. Combined with US Navy and US Air Force Special Operations elements operating under the control of SOCOM, it can precipitate strategic effect with a comparatively minor force commitment. </p> <img src="images/United States Army/image009.png" style="margin:12px;"> <p> <b>US Army Reserve</b>: The Army Reserve is a force of 582,000 personnel, 1/3rd of the total strength of the army. Although the vast majority are ‘part time‘ soldiers, they are well trained and equipped, subject to immediate recall and many have regular army experience. Part of the reserve structure are the 10 ‘Training Division‘ HQs, their primary function is to be a focus for mobilization, training and equipping mobilized troops, and perhaps commanding those troops as a follow on formation, or providing replacements for battle losses. Another factor to consider when examining the diagram below, logistics units are not included, and a large portion of the Army Reserve are logistics units. </p> <img src="images/United States Army/image010.png" style="margin:12px;"> <p> <b>The US Army National Guard</b>: The National Guard (NG) represents 25% of the deployable army and is a fundamental element in the ability of the US Army to succeed in battle. Over 60,000 National Guardsmen deployed to the Gulf War including two formed artillery brigades. The Gulf War also pointed out some shortcomings in NG readiness and a program has been put in place to rectify these. Some units are equipped with the latest generation of equipment while most use slightly older kit, but even that is the same or better than some NATO allies. Four of the NG division HQs, as well as the IX Corps HQ, at least one artillery brigade and probably several other elements have a follow on reinforcement role to NATO. Readiness levels have improved since the Gulf War as have training programs. Most units should be ready to deploy within 30-45 days of mobilization while some will take up to 60 days of training with some re-equipping. It is likely that more than 50,000 NG troops will deploy individually or in small units within the first 14 days of mobilization including up to five artillery brigades, two engineer brigades and one or two aviation brigades. </p> <img src="images/United States Army/image011.png" style="margin:12px;"> <h3>Equipment</h3> <p> <b>Main Battle Tank (MBT)</b> </p> <p> <b><a href="https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m1.htm" target="_blank">M1</a></b>: The extremely successful M1 Abrams MBT began production in 1979 and continued through 1985 when the last of 3,273 were produced for the US Army. This is a 61 ton tanks with a 105mm rifled gun, it can travel at 45 MPH (72 KPH) and has a range of 310 miles (500 Km). This is an excellent, reliable, well proven tank, it has the same gun as the Leopard 1, but is 50% heavier and has a shorter range. The main concern with this MBT is high fuel usage requiring additional logistic support. After sales to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, upgrades to later variants and general attrition are factored in; there are 1630 basic M1s available to the US Army in 1994. </p> <p> <b>M1IP</b>: This version has improved engine performance, efficiency, and better turret armor but in most other ways is the same as the M1. There were 894 produced in 1984. </p> <p> <img src="images/United States Army/image012.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>M1A1</b>: This tank, in addition to other improvements, replaced the gun with the 120mm Smooth bore cannon, the same gun that is on the Leopard 2. In comparison the M1A1 is heavier but achieves the same speed (42 MPH/68 KPH) over a longer distance 288 miles (463 Km) versus the Leopard 2 which achieves a range of 211 miles (340 Km). By 1992 there were 4,976 M1A1s produced. </p> <p> <b>M1A2</b>: Although 190 were produced by 1994, there were about 1000 M1s upgraded to a similar configuration as the M1A1 in particular upgrading the gun. They also had a second thermal site for the commander allowing rapid engagement subsequent targets at night or in obscured conditions. Total available in early 1994 is 1,190. </p> <p> <img src="images/United States Army/image013.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b><a href="http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/M60_Patton.php" target="_blank">M60A3</a></b>: Built in the 1980s, the latest version of the ‘Patton‘ MBT carried the same British made L7, 105mm riffled gun as the M1 Abrams, with a fire control system that produced a 70% hit probability of another tank at 2000 meters. By the time production stopped over 1700 of these tanks had been built and another 1700 older models had been converted to this standard. </p> <p> <b>Disposition of MBTs</b>: As the M1A2 Abrams continues to be produced, an ongoing program is cascading newer MBTs across the entire army. Formations assigned to REFORGER have a higher requirement as they need to provide a fill set of equipment to the POMCUS site, while maintaining a partial set for training in CONUS. Formation assigned to 7th Army Europe, both permanently stationed and REFORGER units require approximately 5,300 MBTs, 1,800 of which will cascade to NG units upon mobilization. Other active army users such as I Corps, 24th ID and PACOM require another 500 MBTs. All of these units are also equipped with the M1A1 or M1A2 Abrams MBTs. Army Reserve elements, NG independent armored battalions and brigades as well as the armored battalions in independent infantry brigades and armored cavalry regiments are equipped with the M1IP.

It is armed with a 25mm ‘Bushmaster‘ chain gun, has a crew of three and carries six soldiers able to dismount to clear the enemy. By 1994 initial production was complete and upgrading older versions to meet the latest standard was underway, this is several months faster then happened historically. In total 4,641 M2s were built with over half being built to the A2 ‘high survivability‘ standard. All but the first 1,600 A0 variants also carried a TOW 2 missile launch system. M2 disposition is roughly equivalent to the M1A2 laydown, with Germany based units and POMCUS sites having the latest A2 variants and CONUS based units, Reserve or NG having the A0. </p> <p> <img src="images/United States Army/image015.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b><a href="http://www.military-today.com/apc/m3_bradley.htm" target="_blank">M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV)</a></b>: Almost identical to the M2 in appearance, the M3 only carries two dismounts, with the remainder of the space used for extra radios, storage and ammunition for the TOW missile systems.

    '<p> Great Britain‘s Royal Navy, with over 450 years of history is the UK‘s Senior Service. Over it‘s history it has fought both against and along side most other navies in NATO. Although by 1994, after three decades of budgetary constrictions, the RN is still a potent force but only a shadow of its former self. Maintaining a full suite of naval capabilities from strategic ballistic missile submarines, through aircraft carriers, an active amphibious force and global logistics, the RN is stretched thin and is some areas only held together by tradition and pride. </p> <img src="images/uk royal navy/uk_royal1.jpg"> <p> The recent war experience in the Falklands gave British politicians and budget conscious bureaucrats a lesson in the cost of neglect. Thus with the increased tension in Europe, the Navy has managed to convince government to infuse it with much needed capital in the form of new build and retained ships. Unfortunately, not much of the new build production has reached the fleet, but readiness is high and capabilities have been moderately improved. </p> <p> Global commitments to support the vestiges of a colonial empire have the RN deployed in every corner of the planet, you are likely to see British ships in all campaigns portrayed in Northern Fury. </p>'

    '<p> <b>British Army</b>: The British Army is a large and diverse organization with long standing traditions and global commitments. One of the key components is the ‘British Army on the Rhine‘ which commanded all British troops on continental Europe during peacetime and took on the responsibilities of NORTHAG HQ in wartime (Northern Army Group). More detail can be found at this link. In all likelihood at least one French Corps would come under command NORTAG as well. </p> <center><img src="images/british army/image001.png"></center> <p> In addition to the BAOR the British Army had significant forces stationed at home. Some of these troops were tasked with reinforcing BAOR while others had Home Defence tasks, and responsibility for security in Northern Ireland. Upon mobilization it was expected that units moving to Germany would arrive and be ready for combat within 72 hours, this was tested on several major exercises and was well planned and rehearsed. The ‘TA‘ (Territorial Army) elements are the equivalent of National Guard, Militia or Reserve forces. 30 Engineer Bde provided general support engineering to NORTHAG, 1st Infantry Bde reinforced HQ Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany while 5th Airborne Bde became a general reserve unit for tasking by SHAPE. If the AMF(L) (ACE[Allied Command Europe] Mobile Force -Land) deployed to Norway the British Battle Group would accompany it, if not this unit would reinforce BAOR. Home defence units, in addition to security, would form a recruiting and training base for replacements into BAOR. </p> <center><img src="images/british army/image002.png"></center> <p> Another key role for the British Army is maintenance of overseas garrisons. Each one is unique and has evolved into its current form through diplomatic commitments, changes to the local threat and availability of forces. The Falklands garrison was only a 45 man Royal Marine platoon when Argentina invaded; the reinforced Battalion Group currently residing there is much more of a deterrent. Training is also a key factor in these overseas garrisons and units tasked to deploy on a rotation, do so with the intent of achieving significant training while stationed abroad. To facilitate this there are established training units in each garrison as well as Kenya and Canada where units deploy specifically for training opportunities. </p> <center><img src="images/british army/image003.png"></center> <p> Finally elements that are not strictly within the Army but which occupy the land environment and therefore share some training and equipment similarities with the Army are shown below. The RAF Regt is primarily dedicated to airfield and nuclear storage site security. The Royal Marine Commando Bde is a unit of the Royal Navy (RN) and able to deploy globally but routinely trains, with an attached Dutch Battalion, for deployment to Norway. The SAS (Special Air Service), along with the SBS (Special Boat Service) controlled by the RN are the UK‘s globally deployable Special Forces element. </p> <center><img src="images/british army/image004.png"></center> <h5>Main Battle Tank (MBT)</h5> <p> <img src="images/british army/image005.png" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Challenger 2</b>: Historically this tank was not integrated into the British Army until 1998, but the first tanks were produced in 1994, three years after being ordered, followed by a further three years of trials and testing. Northern Fury has the first 70 already produced, enough to equip one Tank Regt (Bn) in BAOR. The Challenger 2 marks a significant improvement in MBT capability for the British Army, it has a 120mm rifled gun as opposed to the smooth bore on the Leopard 2, AMX Leclerc or M1A1 or A2 Abrams, allowing the use of HESH (High Explosive Squash Head) ammunition for supporting infantry and ‘bunker busting‘. As far as protection, the Challenger 2 with its improved Chobham armour is, in 1994, probably the most heavily protected tank in the world, others tanks with add on armor improvements, would soon catch up. </p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <img src="images/british army/image006.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Challenger 1</b>: The British Army operated 420 versions of this tank which had a 120mm gun, the original form of Chobham armour and reasonable mobility. Its direct competitor for this generation of tank - the Leopard 1, was faster, and more agile - but less protected and only had a 105mm gun. </p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <img src="images/british army/image007.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Chieftain</b>: Although old, this 1960‘s era tank was cutting edge when produced and was regularly upgraded. It carried the same 120mm rifled gun as the Challengers but its armour was of welded steel construction and therefore much less capable than the composite Chobham armour of its successors. 870 Chieftains, plus a large number of bridge-layers, recovery vehicles and engineering vehicles were still in service in 1994. Over 400 were in storage and available for use, as were 570 of the older Centurion tanks. </p> <div class="clear"></div> <h5>Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV)/Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC)</h5> <p> <img src="images/british army/image008.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Warrior IFV</b>: Initially delivered in 1988, the full order of 1053 was filled in the Northern Fury world (vice the historic reduction to 789) with the last examples coming off the assembly line in the spring of 1994. Representing a quantum leap in capability over the FV-432 series of APC, the Warrior added a 30mm cannon to the firepower of an infantry section, and significantly improved protection and mobility as well. Several command, observation and repair vehicles were also produced. </p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <img src="images/british army/image009.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>FV-432</b>: The FV-432 is the British answer to the American M113 APC, the basic version can carry 10 soldiers in addition to the 2 man crew. Built in several variants this is a versatile and adaptable vehicle but generally underpowered. Early production examples, the Mk1 was produced with a gasoline engine (petrol), most of these have since been replaced by a two stroke multi-fuel engine, still underpowered but more sustainable within the NATO supply system. Over 2400 are in service throughout the British Army. </p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <img src="images/british army/image010.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>CVR-T: Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)</b>: This is a prolific family of vehicles conducting all manner of tasks within the British Army. Seven main variants are in use in 1994: </p><ul> <li>Scorpion: Reconnaissance vehicle with 76mm gun, 313 in use, 184 with the RAF Regt;</li> <li>Striker: Anti-Tank variant with a Swingfire missile system, 89 in use; </li> <li>Spartan: APC with a 3 man crew and 4 passengers, 691 in use; </li> <li>Samaritan: Ambulance variant, 50 in use; </li> <li>Sultan: Command and control vehicle, 291 in use; </li> <li>Samson: Armoured Recovery Vehicle (ARV), 136 in use; </li> <li>Scimitar: Reconnaissance vehicle with a 30mm cannon, 334 in service; </li> </ul> <p></p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <img src="images/british army/image011.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Saxon</b>: Essentially an armoured 4-wheel drive truck, this ‘battle taxi‘ is able to deliver a section of troops in relative protection but with limited off road mobility. 527 of them are in service. </p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <img src="images/british army/image012.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Saracen</b>: Another ‘battle taxi‘, this 6-wheeled APC introduced in the mid 50‘s had several variants.

The M109‘s were historically sold to Austria in late 1994 however that deal was not offered in this storyline, instead the 155mm Close Support Regts in maneuver Bdes were equipped to war strength of 24 guns each, leaving two Regts of Abbots in that role, the rest of the Abbots were put in reserve.

However, in theory the only armed force these tanks would face if this isolated island was invaded, would be the Soviet ‘PT-76‘ light tank or perhaps airborne BMD or amphibious BMP Infantry Fighting Vehicles, so the 76mm high velocity gun and light armour would suffice. <img src="images/denmark army/image003.jpg" style="width:100%;margin:12px;"> </p> <p> <img src="images/denmark army/image002.jpg" style="max-width:320px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>M113</b>: The venerable M113 equipped the Danish mechanized Infantry force.

In addition to these deployable forces, there are six Territorial Defence Regions with assigned troops, the Gendarmerie (para military police force), the French Foreign Legion (mostly in central and northern Africa) and forces overseas in former colonies throughout Africa, Djbouti, Reunion Islands, the French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Caribbean and supporting Coalition operations in the Persian Gulf. </p> <figure> <img src="images/france army/image002.png"> </figure><br> <p> <img src="images/france army/image004.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Leclerc</b>: The French Army was in the initial stages of re-equipping its forces with this new Main Battle Tank (MBT) when Northern Fury occurs. This tank with very modern fire control, advanced armour and a 120mm gun was easily the equivalent of the M1A2 or the Leopard 2 in many respects, probably superior in some areas, and certainly a match for anything the Soviet forces had available at the time. Production commenced in 1992, with the first unit equipped by the end of 1993. Within 2e Régiment de Chasseurs, part of 10th Armoured Division is equipped with 80 of these new tanks, while further production continues at an increased pace. </p> <p> <b>AMX 30</b>: The standard MBT of the French Army, 1,355 of the original AMX 30 were accepted into service and in the 80‘s and early 90‘s the final 271 production tanks and 820 conversions <img src="images/france army/image006.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:left;margin:12px;">(as originally planned and more than historic) were to the AMX 30 B2 standard with an improved fire control system, a better engine. The non-stabilized 105mm gun puts this in an equivalent class to the American M60A1 or the Soviet T-62 - a good tank but not in the same league as the latest NATO or WP competitors. Many variants were produced, including an Air Defence version with Roland missiles, a Self Propelled Gun, engineering variants and even 44 ‘Pluton‘ tactical nuclear missile launchers. </p> <p> <img src="images/france army/image008.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Armoured Cars</b>: The French Army had various armoured cars for divers usage, mostly in the Light Armoured Divisions and reconnaissance roles. Over 425 AML-60 remained in service from an original procurement of over 3000, although there were several hundred in reserve. These are used in a reconnaissance role in most divisions and in the Foreign Legion but also provided the basis of a complete family of vehicles with many variations. The French Gendarmerie also use over one hundred examples of this vehicle. </p> <p> <img src="images/france army/image010.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:left;margin:12px;"> One of the more prolific variants of the AML was the AML-90 with a 90mm low velocity gun (short recoil). The Army uses 210 of these variants in the Light Armoured Divisions, reconnaissance units and for specialized units in other divisions. The Gendarmerie and Foreign Legion also uses this type. </p> <p> <img src="images/france army/image012.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> A more modern vehicle was needed to replace the AML-90 and in the early 80‘s the ERC-90 was produced. Also with a 90mm gun but this was a smooth-bore cannon which allowed the firing of improved Armour-Piercing, Fin-Stabilized, discarding Sabot (APFSDS) ammunition. This improvement enabled a much better capacity to destroy older type Soviet tanks and other armoured vehicles out to a range of 2000 meters. Only 192 of these armoured cars entered service with the Marines, Airborne and Alpine divisions. </p> <p> <img src="images/france army/image014.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:left;margin:12px;"> A more effective vehicle to support light forces is found in the AMX-10RC, which is a heavier 6-wheeled armoured car with a 105mm medium velocity gun. 284 of these vehicles can be round in the tank destroyer and reconnaissance roles in light armoured divisions, mechanized divisions, 9th Marine division and the Foreign Legion. The very capable gun is designed to be fired from light vehicles such as this and with specialized ammunition can penetrated the side of a Soviet MBT at 2000 meters. The hydropneumatic suspension is adaptive and allows for both high speeds and a low profile when needed. </p> <p> <img src="images/france army/image016.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC)</b>: Like most French vehicles, their APCs were all French designed and built, with a mind for the export market. Also these vehicles were only the base and spawned many variations. The tracked APC (AMX-10P) had 15 different variants fielded while the wheeled APC (VAB) developed a staggering 35 variants from a riot control vehicle to Milan and HOT ATGM (Anti-Tank Guided Missile) launcher. All examples of these two vehicle families had NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protection and were amphibious. </p> <p> The tracked AMX-10P was used primarily in the mechanized infantry units of the heavy armoured divisions and their supporting artillery observers. Over 1500 of the base model with a 20mm autocannon were delivered as well as ambulance, recovery, ATGM, artillery observer, radar, mortar and mortar tractors, command, and cargo variants. </p> <p> The wheeled counterpart to the AMX-10 is the VAB (Véhicule de l‘Avant Blindé or Vanguard Armoured Vehicle). This was the most numerous APC in the French Army by a long margin with over 4000 in the inventory and over 1000 more produced for export. These are built in both a 4-wheel and 6-wheel configuration but the vast majority in French service are the 4-wheeled variety. This vehicle is amphibious, lightly armoured and armed and extremely versatile. Every division has at least one unit equipped with the VAB and dozens of variants are in use throughout the force. </p> <figure> <img src="images/france army/image020.jpg"> <figcaption>VAB firing a HOT Anti-Tank Guided Missile.</figcaption> </figure><br> <p> <img src="images/france army/image022.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Artillery</b>: The French produce GCT was a 155mm howitzer built on an AMX 30 chassis. The gun provided NBC protection, and auto-loader enabling a rate of fire of 6-8 rounds per minute out to a range of 23,500 meters. Using rocket assisted projectiles the range increased to 28,000 meters. By 1994, 253 GCTs were in service, replacing most of the old and unprotected Mk3 guns produced in the 50‘s. </p> <p> Numerous older 155mm and 105mm artillery systems were in use in various roles within the French army. </p>'

Since the bulk of both armies were conscripts, reduction of the total strength was simply a management issue. Historically however, over this time the structure and size of the Heer changed significantly between 1993 and 1996 - these changes did not happen.</p> <div class="clear"></div> <figure style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <img src="images/german army/image002.png"> <figcaption>Leopard II</figcaption> </figure> <p><b>Leopard II</b>: Considered by many to be the finest tank in the world with a 120mm L44 smoothbore gun, a speed of 68 KPH, an operational range of 550Km with internal fuel and excellent armor protection. This tank is at least on par with the British Challenger 2, French Leclerc or the American Abrams. By 1994 the full production run of 2,125 was complete, and retained by the Heer. None of the engineering variants of the Leopard 2 had reached production but the Armored recovery vehicle variant was starting to arrive in units by 1994.

    '<p> The modern Luftwaffe, although named the same as its forbearers of World War Two does not draw any continuity earlier than 1956. Although struggling after unification and some internal strife, the Germans retain over 500 front line combat aircraft. Some like the modernized F-4 ICE are nearing the end of their lifespan but with the troubled Eurofighter program not yet producing a replacement, the Tornado is carrying a heavy load in the Luftwaffe. Organizationally air units were grouped in wings, geschwader or Marineflieger with two squadrons (staffel) each. </p> <p> Upon reunification of Germany in 1990 a significant reorganization took place. Most of the aircraft of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR, or East Germany) were passes to Czechoslovakia to hole, in an agreement with the Soviet Union - pending final disposition. Since then over 250 MiG 21‘s, 65 MiG-23‘s, 50 Su-22‘s, 50 L-39‘s, almost 200 helicopters and over 250 SAM systems have found their way into other militaries mostly in Africa but also in South and Central America. The key exception was the two dozen modern MiG-29s which the GDR received only a year before the collapse of its government, these have been fully integrated into the Luftwaffe and have been used extensively by the US and other NATO nations for training. The German MiG pilots are probably the best in the world after four years of force on force training against the finest air forces in the alliance. </p> <p> <img src="images/germany air force/image001.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>MiG-29</b>: The Soviet build MiG-29‘s are the most modern aircraft in the German inventory. They are highly maneuverable multi-role aircraft which have done outstanding service conducting DACT (Dissimilar Air Combat Training) with many NATO nations. Used as aggressors on almost every major NATO exercise since 1990, the pilots of Jagdgeschwader 73 (Fighter Wing 73) became extremely adept at air to air combat. All 24 of these aircraft, including 4 twin seat training variants were maintained in the 1st Squadron 73 JG (1/73 JG) </p> <p> <b>Panavia Tornado</b>: The Tornado is a result of a Tri-national (British, German and Italian) effort to replace aging, <img src="images/germany air force/image002.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:left;margin:12px;">primarily American aircraft in the 80‘s and early 90‘s. This was a highly successful effort with almost 1000 aircraft produced in three variants. The Luftwaffe procured 160 Tornado IDS (Interdiction/Strike) and 34 Tornado ECR (Electronic Combat/Reconnaissance), while the German Navy (Bundesmarine) acquired 112 IDS variants which will be included here. No Air Defence Variants (ADV) were purchased by Germany who were banking on the Eurofighter Typhoon for the air superiority role. That aircraft was yet to make its first flight (March 1994). The intention was that the IDS version would replace all Alpha Jets an F-4F Phantoms in the Fighter Bomber, however due to increased tensions one wing of Phantoms was retained and two wings of Alpha Jets were kept in front line service. Fighter bomber wings are named Jagdbombergeschwader (JBG) </p> <p> The Bundesmarine maintains two wings (Marineflieger or MFG) of 48 aircraft each, specializing in the marine role with AS.34 Kormoran Anti-ship missiles. </p> <p> The Operational Conversion Unit for this type is maintained in the US at Holloman AFB. </p> <table> <thead> <tr><td>Sqn	</td><td>Name</td><td>Location</td><td>	No.</td><td>Type</td> </tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>1/31 JBG	</td><td>Boelcke </td><td>Norvenich</td><td>18</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>2/31 JBG	</td><td>Boelcke	</td><td>Norvenich</td><td>18</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>1/32 JBG	</td><td>Tiger	</td><td>Lechfeld	</td><td>18</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>2/32 JBG	</td><td>Tiger	</td><td>Lechfeld	</td><td>14</td><td>Tornado ECR</td></tr> <tr><td>1/33 JBG	</td><td>Hawk	</td><td>Buchel	</td><td>18</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>2/33 JBG	</td><td>Hawk	</td><td>Buchel	</td><td>18</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>1/34 JBG	</td><td>Allgäu	</td><td>Memmingen</td><td>18</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>1/34 JBG	</td><td>Allgäu	</td><td>Memmingen</td><td>18</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>1/38 JBG	</td><td>Friesland</td><td>Jever	</td><td>18</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>2/38 JBG	</td><td>Friesland</td><td>Jever	</td><td>16</td><td>Tornado ECR</td></tr> <tr><td>1/39 JBG	</td><td> </td><td>Erding	</td><td>12</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>1/MFG 1	</td><td>Sea Hawks</td><td>Nordholtz</td><td>24</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>1/MFG 1	</td><td>Sea Hawks</td><td>Nordholtz</td><td>24</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>1/MFG 2	</td><td>	</td><td>Eggebek	</td><td>24</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> <tr><td>2/MFG 2	</td><td>	</td><td>Eggebek	</td><td>24</td><td>Tornado IDS</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> <img src="images/germany air force/image003.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Alpha Jet</b>: Primarily an advanced jet trainer, the Luftwaffe chose to us this aircraft in the light attack role to replace the Fiat G91.

In order to fill the critical Air-to-Air shortfall in the Luftwaffe while the Eurofighter was being developed the venerable F-4F underwent a modernization program - ICE, meaning Improved Combat Efficiency. The two most significant improvements were the addition of the modern APG-65 radar and the ability to fire AIM-120 AMRAAM BVR (Beyond Visual Range) missiles. 110 conversions were authorized and by the start of Northern Fury 80 had been completed, slightly quicker than historic where 70 had been converted by the end of 94. The major drawback however was the lack of the AIM-120 missile, Germany only ordered 96 for delivery in 2005, leaving the Phantoms to use AIM-7 Sparrows and AIM-9L Sidewinders. Two and a half wings of the ICE were in operations (JG 73 operating one Staffel of MiG-29 and one of F-4 ICE) while three other wings were using the un-modified F-4F‘s. </p> <p> The other key role of the Phantom was that of reconnaissance. Two full wings of RF-4E were relied on to provide intelligence and BDA (Bomb Damage Assessment) using photo, Infrared and SLAR (Side Looking Airborne Radar).

    '<p> <b>Norwegian Army</b>: The Norwegian Army is small, only 19,000 permanent force and much of that was a conscript force, but with a ready reserve of 146,000 and regular mobilization training, the ability to rapidly expand to a potent force was credible. Northern Fury has the Norwegian Army progressing slowly towards the goals of the 1974 Defence Commission proposal. Also with the Olympics ongoing and the increased tension, some units were at a higher state of readiness and several reserve battalions were fully mobilized. Because of the focus on Norway in the Northern Fury Storyline, more detail is provided here than for other countries. </p> <p> <b>Brigade Nord</b>: This is a very unique organization stationed in the Bardufoss area of northern Norway. Each of the three combat arms battalions in Brigade Nord is task tailored for well-practiced and specific tasks, but they are also designed for maximum flexibility and rapid changes of the situation. </p> <p> <b>1st Panzer Bn</b>: Although named as a Panzer or ‘tank‘ battalion, this unit is actually a homogeneous mix of infantry and armor. Designed to provide a counter moves force to the ground commander, it can just as easily block restricted terrain using its tanks as mobile bunkers. The Leopard 1 however is meant for rapid movement and this is how the unit was designed, allow the less mobile infantry and home guard units to slow an advancing enemy while the Panzers attack them where they are vulnerable. </p> <p> <b>2nd Mech Bn</b>: This large battalion is a cross between the traditional Norwegian battalions (Type 78) and the evolving Type 90 that was called for in the defence review. Although the unit now has four instead of three rifle companies, only two are mechanized while the others remain mounted in BV206 over-snow vehicles. Supporting elements within the battalion are all M113 base variants including mortar carriers, TOW anti-armor vehicles, the pioneer/engineer platoon and the reconnaissance squadron. </p> <p> <b>Telemark Bn</b>: This unit, established in 1993 and historically evolved to be a mechanized deployable unit for peace support and COIN operations. In its original design however, as the name suggests, was much different. This unit was meant to become a highly skilled mountain infantry unit, counterbalancing the more heavily mechanized 2nd Battalion. Eventually it will receive some improved BV206 variants for deploying mortars and TOW anti-tank missiles. Currently in Northern Fury, the unit gains mobility by using snowmobiles and skis in the winter, light trucks and motorcycles in the summer. </p> <center><img src="images/norway army/image001.png"></center> <p> The remainder of the Norwegian Army is much more traditionally organized, but due to its unique geography, small population base and rugged terrain, each organization has its differences. Starting in the North and moving South these formations are: </p> <p> <b>6th Division Finmark</b>: A mix of Permanent Force, Reserves and Fortress units, the HQ is also located in Bardufoss. Brigade Nord, responds to national priorities and does not belong to this formation but trains with it regularly. In the early moments of Northern the 105mm artillery battery features prominently as does the East Finmark Battalion (Östre Finnmark Defense Bn). </p> <center><img src="images/norway army/image002.png"></center> <p> <b>4th Division Trondheim</b>: Although 12 &amp; 13 Brigades are a mix between Permanent Force and Reserve, they have been mobilized to provide security for the Olympics in Lillehammer. 12 Brigade is a good example of a ‘Type 90‘ Brigade with an armoured battalion and two infantry battalions, each with four companies. </p> <center><img src="images/norway army/image004.png"></center> <p> <b>V Brigade (Brigade West) Bergan</b>: Another permanent force brigade, part way to the ‘Type 90‘ standard, ‘V‘ Brigade would likely form the nucleus of a division in wartime. </p> <center><img src="images/norway army/image003.png"></center> <p> <b>1st Division South</b>: This formation has the largest concentration of units in the Army. Brigade Sud (South) represents the Permanent Force element while four reserve brigades and 14 independent garrisons round out the structure. In all likelihood these forces would form two divisions in wartime. Most of the trade schools are also located in this area. </p> <center><img src="images/norway army/image005.png"></center> <p> <b>2nd Division Oslo</b>: Finally the Oslo area has another concentration of units. The Kings Guard is a mix between Reserve and Permanent Force but is mobilized for ceremonial duties during the Olympics. </p> <center><img src="images/norway army/image007.png"></center> <p> <img src="images/norway army/image006.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Leopard 1</b>: Like many other nations, Norway decided to purchase the Leopard 1 Main Battle Tank (MBT). A total of 172 MBTs were acquired in addition to several specialist vehicles; 14 Armored Recovery Vehicles (ARV), 9 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB) and 22 Armored Engineering Vehicles (AEV). </p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <img src="images/norway army/image008.png" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>M48A5 Patton</b>: Norway first acquired the M48 Patton in the 1963 when 38 of them were obtained, these were upgraded in the mid 80‘s to the M48A5 standard with a 105mm gun. Also in 1986 an additional 17 were purchased and used as an independent squadron in the Oslo area. The original tanks were retired 1993 when the last of the Leopard 1‘s were put into service but they remain in reserve. </p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <img src="images/norway army/image009.png" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>NM-116 Super Chaffee</b>: 72 M24 Chaffee light tanks were upgraded between 1973 and 1977 and deployed as ‘Tank Destroyers‘ with a low velocity 90mm D-925 gun from France, and many other improvements. Attached to the Anti Tank units in Infantry Brigades it could fire High Explosive (HE), Smoke, and High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) rounds. The HEAT was used to kill tanks and light armored vehicles while the smoke and HE provided excellent support to infantry units. Although retired in 1994, they remain in service for Northern Fury. </p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <img src="images/norway army/image010.png" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>NM-135</b>: This is a modified M113 APC, it has a 20mm autocannon, smoke dischargers and is used as an early and inexpensive Infantry Combat Vehicle (ICV). Some 100 of these vehicles were produced by modifying existing M113‘s but in Northern Fury the total is increased to ~140. This would imply a corresponding reduction of the ~300 M113‘s available but these are easily replaced if required. </p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <img src="images/norway army/image011.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>BV206</b>: The Norwegian Army uses over 1000 of these versatile light vehicles. Used primarily as an infantry section vehicle, modifications have been made to carry mortars and TOW anti-tank missiles, as well as command variant and several other tasks. The video at this link demonstrates the all terrain maneuverability. </p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <img src="images/norway army/image012.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>NM-142</b>: These are M113 vehicles with an early TOW under armor system very similar to the US M901. Norway had 100 of these variants and they worked very closely with the NM-116 in the Anti-Tank companies of Infantry Brigades. </p> <div class="clear"></div> <p> <b>Artillery</b>: The Norwegian Army had several artillery systems: </p><ul> <li>Hundreds of 81mm Mortars	</li> <li>97x M-30F1 107mm Mortars </li> <li>28 M106A1 107mm Self Propelled (SP) Mortars </li> <li>220x M101 105mm Howitzers </li> <li>126x M109A3GN 155mm SP Howitzers </li> <li>48x M114/39 155mm towed Howitzers (39 calibre barrel) </li> <li>~100x M114/23 155mm towed Howitzers (23 calibre barrel) in reserve</li> </ul> <p></p> <p> <b>Air Defense Systems</b>: Several different Air Defense systems were in use.

Even though a small country economically, Norway routinely spent over 3% of its GDP on defence, 50% more than NATO required. </p> <p> NATO realized the critical vulnerability of its northern flank and made provision for rapid deployment to Norway. AMF (ACE [Allied Command Europe] Mobile Force) deployment and pre-positioned equipment was exercised annually.

    '<p><b>Spanish Army</b>: With a strength of 201,000 and 142,000 ready reserves, the Spanish Army was quite a large force but somewhat under equipped in comparison to other armies in NATO. Most formations were designed to be light, with only 300 tanks that could be considered modern in 1994 (AMX-30). Structurally Spain would provide a Corps HQ organized either as a mechanized or a mountain formation to reinforce the land fight in southern Europe, probably Turkey or Greece. There were no forward deployed forces. Divisions were comprised of two brigades, each having two regiments and in turn these had two battalions; slightly smaller than a standard division (8 battalions vice 9) but very heavy on the command element. There are also a number of independent brigades of various types. </p> <p>A good summary of the Spanish Army in 1989 is located <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Spanish_Army_in_1989" target="_blank">here</a>, very little changed between ‘89 and ‘94 when Northern Fury commences.</p> <img src="images/spain army/image001.png" style="float:left;margin:12px;"> <img src="images/spain army/image002.png" style="float:left;margin:12px;"> <div class="clear"></div> <p>In addition to the field army there were elements of supporting forces and also territorial defence forces for Spanish colonies.</p> <img src="images/spain army/image003.png" style="float:left;margin:12px;"> <div class="clear"></div> <p>	<img src="images/spain army/image004.jpg" style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <b>Main Battle Tanks (MBT)</b>: Spain had quite a mix of mostly obsolete MBTs, concentrated in 1st and 3rd Division, there were some older MBTs in 2nd Division as well.</p> <div class="clear"></div> <p><b>AMX-30</b>: Spain built most of its 299 AMX-30E (E for Spanish) under licence from France.

Representing about half of the tanks in service, the 4th Division was equipped entirely with the Leopard 2 while the Panzer Bde in the 5th Division also had these tanks. <img src="images/netherlands army/image003.jpg"> </p> <p> </p><figure style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <img src="images/netherlands army/image004.jpg"> <figcaption>Leopard I</figcaption> </figure> <b>Leopard 1</b>: The other half of the operational tanks in the Netherland‘s roster were Leopard 1V‘s, the ‘V‘ standard had a better fire control system then the original tank. The 468 Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) were used primarily in the 1st Division and the Panzerinfantrie Brigades of the 5th Division. Also many of the Leopard 1 variants were used by the Dutch, including the Bridglayer, and the Armored Recovery Vehicles (ARV). <p></p> <p> <b>Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV)</b>: Although there were about 500 M113‘s and up to 900 YP-408‘s (an 8-wheeled Dutch design from the 50‘s) in the Netherlands Army, the most important IFV was the YPR-765. Although they were derived from the M113, the basic version of YPR-765 was equipped with a 25mm cannon and firing ports so infantry inside the vehicle could fire their weapons. 2079 of these vehicles were used but that includes several command variants, 119 Anti Tank variants (PRAT) with TOW missiles and other specialist vehicles. All of the regular army Panzerinfantrie units were equipped with this vehicle. </p> <p> </p><figure style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <img src="images/netherlands army/image005.jpg"> </figure> <b>Lynx (M113C&amp;V)</b>: For reconnaissance work the Dutch use the M113 based Lynx vehicle but have added a 25mm Oerlikon turret. There are 250 of these in service amongst the Reconnaissance battalions in each division and at corps level. <p></p> <p> <b>Artillery</b>: The Netherlands Corps had extensive artillery firepower including an artillery battalion of 20 M109‘s (Self Propelled (SP) 155mm howitzers) in each of the nine brigades and a Corps Artillery Group of Division size. </p> <p> Within the Corp Artillery organization were three ‘Groups‘ of Brigade size: 101st with two batteries of Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), 22 launchers and a battalion of Lance Missiles, 6 launchers. The other two ‘Groups‘ were General Support (GS) tubed artillery units: The 102nd had five battalions of M110 SP 203mm (8") howitzers and a battalion of M109s; the 104th Group (Reserve) had five battalions of towed 155mm guns, the M114/39. </p> <p> In total the inventory included: </p><ul> <li>22 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS);</li> <li>6 MGM-52 Lance; (not retired)</li> <li>76 M110A2 203 mm SP howitzers;</li> <li>222 M109 155 mm self-propelled howitzers (A2 &amp; A3 variants);</li> <li>123 M114 155 mm towed howitzers.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p> <b>Note</b>: Historically only 82 of the M114‘s had been upgraded to the 39 Caliber barrel. but in Northern Fury all 123 were and in addition to the 4th battery added to each battalion in 104th Group, two of the retired (in 1990) battalions were retained.

Approximately 42 ‘A‘ models have been upgraded to the MLU standard and equip two Squadrons based at Volkel. Another modification for Dutch F-16s is the ability to operate the Orpheus Reconnaissance Pod, currently 306 Sqn is equipped for this task. No. 315 ‘Lion‘ Squadron was tasked with deploying to Norway in times of emergency as a NATO AMF (ACE Mobile Force) unit. </p> <p> In addition to a training squadron in Tucson Arizona, there is a test and evaluation unit stationed at Volkel.
