  'Although Germany reunified in 1990, all is not celebrations and roses in the Northern Fury world. With the Soviet Union in resurgence, economic pressures in Germany and a political movement to leave NATO has caused significant instability in Berlin and throughout northern and eastern Germany in particular. Strong internal movements in Bavaria have been a counter to the left wing movements in the north causing further disunity.\n\nMilitarily, unification did little to boost Germany‘s capabilities. Most of the ships were sold off or simply scrapped. Germany retained seven patrol boats, an icebreaker, survey ship and several smaller craft. A list of the actual transfers can be found here. The air force of the former East Germany held some 1000 aircraft, all but a single squadron of 22 MiG-29‘s were sold off or scrapped within six months of reunification. The Bundeswehr was reduced to 370,000 personnel. This was Germany‘s contribution to the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe. As a result, the Bundeswehr was significantly reduced, and the former East German National Volksarmee (NVA) was disbanded.',

  '**German Army (Deutsches Heer)**: The current form of the German Army was founded on 12 November 1955, when West Germany joined the NATO alliance and reformed the military branch of government (Bundeswehr). By 1985 the army was at its established strength of 12 Divisions. The diagram below depicts the peacetime organizational structure. However, in wartime 3rd Panzer Division (I Corps) would transfer to the 1st Netherlands Corps, while 26 & 27 Fallschirmjäger Brigades would join 1st Fallschirmjäger Division and become SHAPE reserve.\n\nThe **Schleswig-Holstein Territorial Command (SH)** in wartime would take charge of several home defence Brigades and Regiments and operate as a Division or possibly Corps level HQ under **Allied Command Baltic Approaches (BALTAP)**. 6th Panzergrenadier Division would also come under command BALTAP and, depending on the situation, operate independently or under the command of **SH**.\n\n![](images/german army/image001.png)\n\nThe pre-unification army had a strength of approximately 340,000 regulars and 717,000 reserves and territorial defence forces. The regular forces could deploy to their wartime (GDP - General Defence Plan) positions within 24 hours and full mobilization of reserves and territorials would happen within 3-4 days.\n\nAfter unification the Heer merged with the Nationale Volksarmee of the former East Germany, forming a IV Corps headquartered in Potsdam, starting in 1990. Between 1990 and 1994 this fourth Corps was reduced in size until it was replaced in the Berlin/Potsdam area by III Corps. Very little former East German equipment was held, most of it was sold to finance unification. Since the bulk of both armies were conscripts, reduction of the total strength was simply a management issue. Historically however, over this time the structure and size of the Heer changed significantly between 1993 and 1996 - these changes did not happen.\n\n![](images/german army/image002.png)\n\nLeopard II\n\n**Leopard II**: Considered by many to be the finest tank in the world with a 120mm L44 smoothbore gun, a speed of 68 KPH, an operational range of 550Km with internal fuel and excellent armor protection. This tank is at least on par with the British Challenger 2, French Leclerc or the American Abrams. By 1994 the full production run of 2,125 was complete, and retained by the Heer. None of the engineering variants of the Leopard 2 had reached production but the Armored recovery vehicle variant was starting to arrive in units by 1994. Leopard I specialist variants were used instead.\n\n![](images/german army/image004.jpg)\n\nLeopard I\n\n**Leopard I**: The Leopard I was used widely throughout Europe and Canada as well. The German Army operated a total of 2,437 of them. With the introduction of the Leopard II, some were put into storage but most replaced M48s in reserve units. 1,225 tanks were upgraded to the ultimate ‘A5‘ standard, while 250 were ‘A4‘ versions, 110 were ‘A3‘, 232 were ‘A2‘ and the remainder were upgraded to the improved Leopard 1 A1A1 standard. In addition to the original production were large numbers of specialist vehicles such as:\n\n*   377x Gepard Anti-Aircraft variants;\n*   105x Biber Bridge Layers;\n*   444x Bergepanzer 2 Armored Recovery Vehicles (ARV);\n*   36x Bergepanzer 2A1 ARV for engineer vehicles;\n*   140x Badger Engineering vehicles;\n\n![](images/german army/image005.jpg)\n\nGepard\n\n![](images/german army/image006.jpg)\n\nBiber Bridge Layer\n\n![](images/german army/image007.jpg)\n\nBergepanzer ARV\n\n![](images/german army/image008.jpg)\n\nBadger\n\n![](images/german army/image009.png)\n\n**Luchs Armored Reconnaissance Vehicle**: The German Army used 408 of these 8-wheeled amphibious vehicles in their reconnaissance battalions. With 8-wheel drive and all wheel steering, being equipped with thermal sites, a 20mm cannon and long range radios, it was ideal for the job it was tasked for.\n\n![](images/german army/image010.jpg)\n\n**Marder IFV**: Germany was the first NATO country to adopt the IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) concept with the Marder. 2,133 of these vehicles were used in Panzergrenadiere units. In addition to the 20mm Cannon and the Milan ATGM (Anti Tank Guided Missile), the soldiers in the passenger compartment can engage targets from inside the vehicle or quickly dismount and assault. The Marder can carry 12 infantrymen but normally carried a crew of 3 with 7 dismountable soldiers as passengers.\n\n![](images/german army/image011.jpg)\n\n**M113 Family**: More than 4,000 of the ubiquitous M113, in addition to thousands used as infantry carriers‘ numerous variants are found in the German Army, including:\n\n*   +220x M577 Command Post;\n*   +500x Panzermorser 120 - 120mm Self Propelled Mortar;\n*   154x Artillery Fire Control variants;\n*   320x Beobachtungs Panzer Artillery observation vehicles;\n*   301x M548G Skorpion Minenwerfer, mobile mine dispenser;\n*   Forward Air Controller variant;\n*   Electronic Direction Finding variant;\n*   Signals vehicle;\n*   Ambulances;\n*   Radar carriers;\n*   Artillery locating Radar carrier;\n\n![](images/german army/image012.jpg)\n\n**Fuchs Series**: The Fuchs is a Six-wheeled Armored Personnel Carrier (APC). The German Heer operated 1,040 of these vehicles in several variants. The basic vehicle was an amphibious and designed to carry a crew of 2 with 10 passengers. Variants include:\n\n*   550x Standard Fuchs 1;\n*   87x Non amphibious versions with larger payload;\n*   265x fitted with various mission kits;\n*   140x NBC reconnaissance vehicles;\n\n![](images/german army/image014.jpg)\n\nJaguar 1\n\n**Tank Destroyers**: Three types of tank destroyers were used by the German Army. The idea was that these had the firepower of a tank but neither the maneuverability nor the protection. By 1994 they didn‘t have the firepower either.\n\n*   607x Kanonenjagdpanzer, with a 90mm gun;\n*   162x Jaguar 2, a Kanonenjagdpanzer with the gun replaced by a TOW2 ATGM\n*   316x Jaguar 1, a similar chassis with a HOT ATGM\n\n![](images/german army/image015.jpg)\n\nJaguar 2\n\n![](images/german army/image016.jpg)\n\nKanonenjagdpanzer',

  'The modern Luftwaffe, although named the same as its forbearers of World War Two does not draw any continuity earlier than 1956. Although struggling after unification and some internal strife, the Germans retain over 500 front line combat aircraft. Some like the modernized F-4 ICE are nearing the end of their lifespan but with the troubled Eurofighter program not yet producing a replacement, the Tornado is carrying a heavy load in the Luftwaffe. Organizationally air units were grouped in wings, geschwader or Marineflieger with two squadrons (staffel) each.\n\nUpon reunification of Germany in 1990 a significant reorganization took place. Most of the aircraft of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR, or East Germany) were passes to Czechoslovakia to hole, in an agreement with the Soviet Union - pending final disposition. Since then over 250 MiG 21‘s, 65 MiG-23‘s, 50 Su-22‘s, 50 L-39‘s, almost 200 helicopters and over 250 SAM systems have found their way into other militaries mostly in Africa but also in South and Central America. The key exception was the two dozen modern MiG-29s which the GDR received only a year before the collapse of its government, these have been fully integrated into the Luftwaffe and have been used extensively by the US and other NATO nations for training. The German MiG pilots are probably the best in the world after four years of force on force training against the finest air forces in the alliance.\n\n![](images/germany air force/image001.jpg) **MiG-29**: The Soviet build MiG-29‘s are the most modern aircraft in the German inventory. They are highly maneuverable multi-role aircraft which have done outstanding service conducting DACT (Dissimilar Air Combat Training) with many NATO nations. Used as aggressors on almost every major NATO exercise since 1990, the pilots of Jagdgeschwader 73 (Fighter Wing 73) became extremely adept at air to air combat. All 24 of these aircraft, including 4 twin seat training variants were maintained in the 1st Squadron 73 JG (1/73 JG)\n\n**Panavia Tornado**: The Tornado is a result of a Tri-national (British, German and Italian) effort to replace aging, ![](images/germany air force/image002.jpg)primarily American aircraft in the 80‘s and early 90‘s. This was a highly successful effort with almost 1000 aircraft produced in three variants. The Luftwaffe procured 160 Tornado IDS (Interdiction/Strike) and 34 Tornado ECR (Electronic Combat/Reconnaissance), while the German Navy (Bundesmarine) acquired 112 IDS variants which will be included here. No Air Defence Variants (ADV) were purchased by Germany who were banking on the Eurofighter Typhoon for the air superiority role. That aircraft was yet to make its first flight (March 1994). The intention was that the IDS version would replace all Alpha Jets an F-4F Phantoms in the Fighter Bomber, however due to increased tensions one wing of Phantoms was retained and two wings of Alpha Jets were kept in front line service. Fighter bomber wings are named Jagdbombergeschwader (JBG)\n\nThe Bundesmarine maintains two wings (Marineflieger or MFG) of 48 aircraft each, specializing in the marine role with AS.34 Kormoran Anti-ship missiles.\n\nThe Operational Conversion Unit for this type is maintained in the US at Holloman AFB.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\n1/31 JBG\n\nBoelcke\n\nNorvenich\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n2/31 JBG\n\nBoelcke\n\nNorvenich\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/32 JBG\n\nTiger\n\nLechfeld\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n2/32 JBG\n\nTiger\n\nLechfeld\n\n14\n\nTornado ECR\n\n1/33 JBG\n\nHawk\n\nBuchel\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n2/33 JBG\n\nHawk\n\nBuchel\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/34 JBG\n\nAllgäu\n\nMemmingen\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/34 JBG\n\nAllgäu\n\nMemmingen\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/38 JBG\n\nFriesland\n\nJever\n\n18\n\nTornado IDS\n\n2/38 JBG\n\nFriesland\n\nJever\n\n16\n\nTornado ECR\n\n1/39 JBG\n\nErding\n\n12\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/MFG 1\n\nSea Hawks\n\nNordholtz\n\n24\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/MFG 1\n\nSea Hawks\n\nNordholtz\n\n24\n\nTornado IDS\n\n1/MFG 2\n\nEggebek\n\n24\n\nTornado IDS\n\n2/MFG 2\n\nEggebek\n\n24\n\nTornado IDS\n\n![](images/germany air force/image003.jpg) **Alpha Jet**: Primarily an advanced jet trainer, the Luftwaffe chose to us this aircraft in the light attack role to replace the Fiat G91. Although used as a weapons training platform in Beja Portugal, most advanced training for the Luftwaffe was conducted in the US using American facilities and aircraft. In 1993 an agreement with Portugal for the continued use of Beja included passing 50 Alpha Jets to that country, this deal was kept but further sales of Alpha Jets were cancel and two wings were maintained in front line service.\n\nSqn\n\nLocation\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\n1/49 JBG\n\nFürstenfeldbruck\n\n18\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n2/49 JBG\n\nFürstenfeldbruck\n\n18\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n1/43 JBG\n\nOldenburg\n\n18\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n2/43 JBG\n\nOldenburg\n\n18\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n1/44 JBG\n\nBeja Portugal\n\n18\n\nAlpha Jet\n\n![](images/germany air force/image004.jpg) **F-4 Phantom**: Germany used the F-4 extensively from 1971 onwards, originally operating 175 F-4F‘s and 88 RF-4E‘s operationally and several F-4E‘s for training in the US. In order to fill the critical Air-to-Air shortfall in the Luftwaffe while the Eurofighter was being developed the venerable F-4F underwent a modernization program - ICE, meaning Improved Combat Efficiency. The two most significant improvements were the addition of the modern APG-65 radar and the ability to fire AIM-120 AMRAAM BVR (Beyond Visual Range) missiles. 110 conversions were authorized and by the start of Northern Fury 80 had been completed, slightly quicker than historic where 70 had been converted by the end of 94. The major drawback however was the lack of the AIM-120 missile, Germany only ordered 96 for delivery in 2005, leaving the Phantoms to use AIM-7 Sparrows and AIM-9L Sidewinders. Two and a half wings of the ICE were in operations (JG 73 operating one Staffel of MiG-29 and one of F-4 ICE) while three other wings were using the un-modified F-4F‘s.\n\nThe other key role of the Phantom was that of reconnaissance. Two full wings of RF-4E were relied on to provide intelligence and BDA (Bomb Damage Assessment) using photo, Infrared and SLAR (Side Looking Airborne Radar). The preferred method of operation was low and fast.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\n1/35 JBG\n\nMemmingen\n\n18\n\nF-4F\n\n2/35 JBG\n\nMemmingen\n\n18\n\nF-4F\n\n1/36 JBG\n\nHopsten\n\n18\n\nF-4F\n\n2/36 JBG\n\nHopsten\n\n18\n\nF-4F\n\n1/51 AG\n\nImmelman\n\nBremgarten\n\n18\n\nRF-4E\n\n2/51 AG\n\nImmelman\n\nBremgarten\n\n18\n\nRF-4E\n\n1/52 AG\n\nLeck\n\n18\n\nRF-4E\n\n2/52 AG\n\nLeck\n\n18\n\nRF-4E\n\n1/71 JG\n\nRichthofen\n\nWitt~mund\n\n16\n\nF-4F ICE\n\n2/71 JG\n\nRichthofen\n\nWitt~mund\n\n16\n\nF-4F ICE\n\n1/72 JG\n\nWestfalen\n\nHopsten\n\n18\n\nF-4F\n\n2/72 JG\n\nWestfalen\n\nHopsten\n\n18\n\nF-4F\n\n2/73 JG\n\nSteinhoff\n\nLaage\n\n16\n\nF-4F ICE\n\n1/74 JG\n\nMolders\n\nNeuburg\n\n16\n\nF-4F ICE\n\n2/74 JG\n\nMolders\n\nNeuburg\n\n16\n\nF-4F ICE\n\n![](images/germany air force/image005.jpg) **HFB-320 ECM**: Eight of these rather odd business jets were used by the Luftwaffe for Electronic Countermeasures training and operations from the early 70‘s.
