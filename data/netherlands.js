  'The Netherlands Army was mainly deployed in a Corps organization. The three Dutch mechanized infantry divisions were organized along streamlined Brigade Group structures without divisional troops. The corps troops organizations, particularly artillery and engineer were quite extensive which allowed for very flexible grouping based on the mission assigned. Although each mechanized division has a Panzer Brigade, and the other two Brigades in each division has a Panzer Battalion, the armored punch of the corps comes from the attached German Panzer division. ![](images/netherlands army/image001.png)\n\nThe other key element of the Netherlands ground forces are the Netherlands Marines. This is a unique organization which does not normally operate as a unit, but in separately tasked battalion sized ‘Groups‘. ![](images/netherlands army/image002.png)\n\nBoth the 1st Group and the Parachute Company would normally be assigned to work with the British 3rd Commando Bde. These troops were trained for mountain and arctic warfare and would routinely train to deploy in Northern Norway.\n\nThe 2nd Group was dispersed throughout Dutch colonies in the Caribbean and West Indies, primarily providing local security but also able to form into a strike force if necessary.\n\nThe 3rd Group were reservists, formerly enrolled as marines this unit would initially provide security at naval bases but then would develop several Marine Battalions or a Marine Regiment for deployment.\n\n**Leopard 2**: The Dutch are the second largest operator of the Leopard 2, with 445 of them in the inventory. Starting in 1993, many (eventually 330) were upgraded to the Leopard 2A5 standard with improved armor. Representing about half of the tanks in service, the 4th Division was equipped entirely with the Leopard 2 while the Panzer Bde in the 5th Division also had these tanks. ![](images/netherlands army/image003.jpg)\n\n![](images/netherlands army/image004.jpg)\n\nLeopard I\n\n**Leopard 1**: The other half of the operational tanks in the Netherland‘s roster were Leopard 1V‘s, the ‘V‘ standard had a better fire control system then the original tank. The 468 Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) were used primarily in the 1st Division and the Panzerinfantrie Brigades of the 5th Division. Also many of the Leopard 1 variants were used by the Dutch, including the Bridglayer, and the Armored Recovery Vehicles (ARV).\n\n**Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV)**: Although there were about 500 M113‘s and up to 900 YP-408‘s (an 8-wheeled Dutch design from the 50‘s) in the Netherlands Army, the most important IFV was the YPR-765. Although they were derived from the M113, the basic version of YPR-765 was equipped with a 25mm cannon and firing ports so infantry inside the vehicle could fire their weapons. 2079 of these vehicles were used but that includes several command variants, 119 Anti Tank variants (PRAT) with TOW missiles and other specialist vehicles. All of the regular army Panzerinfantrie units were equipped with this vehicle.\n\n![](images/netherlands army/image005.jpg)\n\n**Lynx (M113C&V)**: For reconnaissance work the Dutch use the M113 based Lynx vehicle but have added a 25mm Oerlikon turret. There are 250 of these in service amongst the Reconnaissance battalions in each division and at corps level.\n\n**Artillery**: The Netherlands Corps had extensive artillery firepower including an artillery battalion of 20 M109‘s (Self Propelled (SP) 155mm howitzers) in each of the nine brigades and a Corps Artillery Group of Division size.\n\nWithin the Corp Artillery organization were three ‘Groups‘ of Brigade size: 101st with two batteries of Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), 22 launchers and a battalion of Lance Missiles, 6 launchers. The other two ‘Groups‘ were General Support (GS) tubed artillery units: The 102nd had five battalions of M110 SP 203mm (8") howitzers and a battalion of M109s; the 104th Group (Reserve) had five battalions of towed 155mm guns, the M114/39.\n\nIn total the inventory included:\n\n*   22 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS);\n*   6 MGM-52 Lance; (not retired)\n*   76 M110A2 203 mm SP howitzers;\n*   222 M109 155 mm self-propelled howitzers (A2 & A3 variants);\n*   123 M114 155 mm towed howitzers.\n\n**Note**: Historically only 82 of the M114‘s had been upgraded to the 39 Caliber barrel. but in Northern Fury all 123 were and in addition to the 4th battery added to each battalion in 104th Group, two of the retired (in 1990) battalions were retained. In addition, the Lance missiles (retired in 92) were maintained.',
    netherlands_air_force:
  '**Netherlands Air Force**: The Dutch Air Force has a single focus of defending the airspace of Western Europe and it is tied directly into the operations of 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force (2 ATAF). Although there are supporting elements there are two key segments to that role: The F-16; and Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) in the form of Patriot and I-Hawk missile units.\n\n![](images/netherlands air force/image001.jpg) **F-16**: As one of the four European nations using the F-16 they were key in the development of the Fokker assembly plant in Holland. In total 213 F-16A/B were acquired (177 single seat ‘A‘ models, and 58 double seat ‘B‘ versions). The first was delivered in 1979 and the last in 1992.\n\nAs a result of the increased tensions in the Northern Fury storyline, upgrade of the older F-16s to the MLU (Mid Life Upgrade) standard, allowing them to use the Aim-120 AMRAAN missile and the AGM-65 Maverick missile began as soon as the last production model was complete. Approximately 42 ‘A‘ models have been upgraded to the MLU standard and equip two Squadrons based at Volkel. Another modification for Dutch F-16s is the ability to operate the Orpheus Reconnaissance Pod, currently 306 Sqn is equipped for this task. No. 315 ‘Lion‘ Squadron was tasked with deploying to Norway in times of emergency as a NATO AMF (ACE Mobile Force) unit.\n\nIn addition to a training squadron in Tucson Arizona, there is a test and evaluation unit stationed at Volkel. Each operational squadron maintains some ‘B‘ model twin seat versions for readiness and refresher training.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\nRemarks\n\n306\n\nHawk\n\nVolkel\n\n18\n\nF-16A Recon\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n311\n\nEagle\n\nVolkel\n\n20\n\nF-16A MLU\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n312\n\nBonzo\n\nVolkel\n\n20\n\nF-16A MLU\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n313\n\nTiger\n\nTwenthe\n\n20\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n314\n\nRedskins\n\nGilze-Rijen\n\n20\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n315\n\nLion\n\nTwenthe\n\n16\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n316\n\nFalcon\n\nEindhoven\n\n20\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n322\n\nPolly Parrot\n\nLeeuwarden\n\n20\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n323\n\nDiana\n\nLeeuwarden\n\n20\n\nF-16A\n\n+4x F-16B\n\n![](images/netherlands air force/image002.jpg) **F-5A**: Although the NF-5 was retired from service in 1992, the Netherlands Air Force maintains them in ready reserve. 105 aircraft (75 single seat and 30 double seat) are in storage ready to mobilize. It will likely only take 2-3 weeks to organize reserve pilots into new squadrons.\n\n![](images/netherlands air force/image003.jpg) **KDC-10**: Historically the Dutch Air Force received its two KC-10 aerial refuelling aircraft in 1995 but the requirement was identified in 1992 and there were several delays in converting the civilian pattern DC-10 airliners to military refuelling standard. In Northern Fury, the delays were avoided and the two aircraft were delivered to 334th ‘Pegasus‘ Squadron at Eindhoven in late 1994.\n\n**C-130 Hercules**: Also at Eindhoven is 336 Squadron operating 4x C-130H in the transport role.\n\n**Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD)**: The other element fielded by the Netherlands Air Force is GBAD. Each airbase (seven) has an Air Defence (AD) Squadron consisting of 3x I-Hawk missile launchers, 3x Bofors 40L70 gun systems and local ‘Flycatcher‘ radars. Additionally, there are two AD Groups with four squadrons, two each of the older I-HAWK (6 launchers per Squadron), and the newer Patriot missile systems (5 launchers per Squadron). Although only 160 Patriot missiles were purchased, a factory in the Netherlands will produce ~2000 missiles for the US so supply in an emergency should not be a problem. ![](images/netherlands air force/image005.jpg) ![](images/netherlands air force/image006.jpg)',
    netherlands_navy:
  'The Royal Netherlands Navy dates back to the 16th century where it was one of the most powerful navies in the world, fighting against most of its European neighbours. Today it is a much more modest force but carries on long standing traditions of duty and seamanship. Based largely on Frigates this very capable navy has some excellent ships.\n\n![](images/netherlands navy/image001.jpg) **[Tromp Class](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Netherlands-Navy/Frigate/Tromp-class.htm)**: Built to be Task Group (TG) Flagships, these two area air defence ships would be classed as Destroyers in most other navies. At 4000 tons and carrying both long range ‘Standard‘ Surface to Air Missiles (SAM) for air defence and short range ‘Sea Sparrow‘, these ships could simultaneously protect the TG and themselves. Commissioned in 1975 & 76 they are approaching their mid life point in Northern Fury.\n\nPennant\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nF801\n\nTromp\n\nDry Dock\n\nAmsterdam\n\nHigh Readiness\n\nF806\n\nDe Ruyter\n\nActive\n\nNorth Sea\n\n![](images/netherlands navy/image002.jpg) **[Karel Doorman Class](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Netherlands-Navy/Frigate/Karel-Doorman-class.htm)**: These multi-purpose ships are emerging from the building yards as war starts. The lead ship in the Class was commissioned in 1991, while the 6th ship was rushed into commission in December of 1993, the 7th is fitting out and should be commissioned in several months, leaving only the last ship in the class on the sidelines. Although not overly capable in any one role, these ships provide very capable and modern sensors to a TG and, like most Frigates, make an excellent life support system for an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) helicopter, in this case the Westland Lynx.\n\nPennant\n\nShip\n\nStatus\n\nLocation\n\nTask\n\nF827\n\n[Karel Doorman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_frigate_Leopold_I_(F930))\n\nActive\n\nBaltic\n\nPatrol\n\nF829\n\n[Willem van der Zaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_frigate_Louise-Marie_(F931))\n\nActive\n\nMediterranean\n\nCruise\n\nF830\n\n[Tjerk Hiddes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Tjerk_Hiddes_(F830))\n\nActive\n\nNorth Sea\n\nTraining\n\nF831\n\n[Van Amstel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Van_Amstel_(F831))\n\nActive\n\nNorth Sea\n\nPort Call London\n\nF832\n\n[Abraham van der Hulst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Abraham_Van_Der_Hulst_(F832))\n\nActive\n\nRotterdam\n\nMaintenance\n\nF833\n\n[Van Nes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Van_Nes_(F833))\n\nActive\n\nNorth Sea\n\nSTANAVFORLANT\n\nF834\n\n[Van Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HNLMS_Van_Galen_(F834)&action=edit&redlink=1)\n\nFitting out\n\nAmsterdam\n\nF828\n\n[Van Speijk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HNLMS_Van_Speijk_(F828))\n\nBuilding\n\nAmsterdam\n\n![](images/netherlands navy/image003.jpg) **[Kortenaer Class](http://www.seaforces.org/marint/Netherlands-Navy/Frigate/Kortenaer-Standard-class.htm)**: This class of 10 ships were very similar to the German Bremen class and were primarily an ASW patrol and escort ship.

Although each Sqn operates six aircraft, there are two permanently located at Curacao in the Caribbean and two more permanently located an NAS Sigonella in the Mediterranean.\n\n![](images/netherlands navy/image009.jpg) **Lynx**: Three different versions of this helicopter were used: The Mk.25 (SH-14A) was used for utility and SAR missions, six were used and they are being upgraded to the (SH-14B) model. The 18 Mk.27 initially received had basic ASW capability and have been upgraded to the Mk.81/SH-14C standard by adding a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD). The SH-14C are capable of carrying out the SAR task as well.'
