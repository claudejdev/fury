Their hulls are strengthened to withstand limited ice crushing, or ice browsing. Although it only carries a 57mm gun and machine guns, it can be fitted with Depth Charges, Penguin anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, 20mm guns and Mistral SAMs in wartime. The peacetime crew is 52 plus 6 for the air detachment, its wartime establishment is 76 and it has bunk space for 109.

  '**Norwegian Army**: The Norwegian Army is small, only 19,000 permanent force and much of that was a conscript force, but with a ready reserve of 146,000 and regular mobilization training, the ability to rapidly expand to a potent force was credible. Northern Fury has the Norwegian Army progressing slowly towards the goals of the 1974 Defence Commission proposal. Also with the Olympics ongoing and the increased tension, some units were at a higher state of readiness and several reserve battalions were fully mobilized. Because of the focus on Norway in the Northern Fury Storyline, more detail is provided here than for other countries.\n\n**Brigade Nord**: This is a very unique organization stationed in the Bardufoss area of northern Norway. Each of the three combat arms battalions in Brigade Nord is task tailored for well-practiced and specific tasks, but they are also designed for maximum flexibility and rapid changes of the situation.\n\n**1st Panzer Bn**: Although named as a Panzer or ‘tank‘ battalion, this unit is actually a homogeneous mix of infantry and armor. Designed to provide a counter moves force to the ground commander, it can just as easily block restricted terrain using its tanks as mobile bunkers. The Leopard 1 however is meant for rapid movement and this is how the unit was designed, allow the less mobile infantry and home guard units to slow an advancing enemy while the Panzers attack them where they are vulnerable.\n\n**2nd Mech Bn**: This large battalion is a cross between the traditional Norwegian battalions (Type 78) and the evolving Type 90 that was called for in the defence review. Although the unit now has four instead of three rifle companies, only two are mechanized while the others remain mounted in BV206 over-snow vehicles. Supporting elements within the battalion are all M113 base variants including mortar carriers, TOW anti-armor vehicles, the pioneer/engineer platoon and the reconnaissance squadron.\n\n**Telemark Bn**: This unit, established in 1993 and historically evolved to be a mechanized deployable unit for peace support and COIN operations. In its original design however, as the name suggests, was much different. This unit was meant to become a highly skilled mountain infantry unit, counterbalancing the more heavily mechanized 2nd Battalion. Eventually it will receive some improved BV206 variants for deploying mortars and TOW anti-tank missiles. Currently in Northern Fury, the unit gains mobility by using snowmobiles and skis in the winter, light trucks and motorcycles in the summer.\n\n![](images/norway army/image001.png)\n\nThe remainder of the Norwegian Army is much more traditionally organized, but due to its unique geography, small population base and rugged terrain, each organization has its differences. Starting in the North and moving South these formations are:\n\n**6th Division Finmark**: A mix of Permanent Force, Reserves and Fortress units, the HQ is also located in Bardufoss. Brigade Nord, responds to national priorities and does not belong to this formation but trains with it regularly. In the early moments of Northern the 105mm artillery battery features prominently as does the East Finmark Battalion (Östre Finnmark Defense Bn).\n\n![](images/norway army/image002.png)\n\n**4th Division Trondheim**: Although 12 & 13 Brigades are a mix between Permanent Force and Reserve, they have been mobilized to provide security for the Olympics in Lillehammer. 12 Brigade is a good example of a ‘Type 90‘ Brigade with an armoured battalion and two infantry battalions, each with four companies.\n\n![](images/norway army/image004.png)\n\n**V Brigade (Brigade West) Bergan**: Another permanent force brigade, part way to the ‘Type 90‘ standard, ‘V‘ Brigade would likely form the nucleus of a division in wartime.\n\n![](images/norway army/image003.png)\n\n**1st Division South**: This formation has the largest concentration of units in the Army. Brigade Sud (South) represents the Permanent Force element while four reserve brigades and 14 independent garrisons round out the structure. In all likelihood these forces would form two divisions in wartime. Most of the trade schools are also located in this area.\n\n![](images/norway army/image005.png)\n\n**2nd Division Oslo**: Finally the Oslo area has another concentration of units. The Kings Guard is a mix between Reserve and Permanent Force but is mobilized for ceremonial duties during the Olympics.\n\n![](images/norway army/image007.png)\n\n![](images/norway army/image006.jpg) **Leopard 1**: Like many other nations, Norway decided to purchase the Leopard 1 Main Battle Tank (MBT). A total of 172 MBTs were acquired in addition to several specialist vehicles; 14 Armored Recovery Vehicles (ARV), 9 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB) and 22 Armored Engineering Vehicles (AEV).\n\n![](images/norway army/image008.png) **M48A5 Patton**: Norway first acquired the M48 Patton in the 1963 when 38 of them were obtained, these were upgraded in the mid 80‘s to the M48A5 standard with a 105mm gun. Also in 1986 an additional 17 were purchased and used as an independent squadron in the Oslo area. The original tanks were retired 1993 when the last of the Leopard 1‘s were put into service but they remain in reserve.\n\n![](images/norway army/image009.png) **NM-116 Super Chaffee**: 72 M24 Chaffee light tanks were upgraded between 1973 and 1977 and deployed as ‘Tank Destroyers‘ with a low velocity 90mm D-925 gun from France, and many other improvements. Attached to the Anti Tank units in Infantry Brigades it could fire High Explosive (HE), Smoke, and High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) rounds. The HEAT was used to kill tanks and light armored vehicles while the smoke and HE provided excellent support to infantry units. Although retired in 1994, they remain in service for Northern Fury.\n\n![](images/norway army/image010.png) **NM-135**: This is a modified M113 APC, it has a 20mm autocannon, smoke dischargers and is used as an early and inexpensive Infantry Combat Vehicle (ICV). Some 100 of these vehicles were produced by modifying existing M113‘s but in Northern Fury the total is increased to ~140. This would imply a corresponding reduction of the ~300 M113‘s available but these are easily replaced if required.\n\n![](images/norway army/image011.jpg) **BV206**: The Norwegian Army uses over 1000 of these versatile light vehicles. Used primarily as an infantry section vehicle, modifications have been made to carry mortars and TOW anti-tank missiles, as well as command variant and several other tasks. The video at this link demonstrates the all terrain maneuverability.\n\n![](images/norway army/image012.jpg) **NM-142**: These are M113 vehicles with an early TOW under armor system very similar to the US M901. Norway had 100 of these variants and they worked very closely with the NM-116 in the Anti-Tank companies of Infantry Brigades.\n\n**Artillery**: The Norwegian Army had several artillery systems:\n\n*   Hundreds of 81mm Mortars\n*   97x M-30F1 107mm Mortars\n*   28 M106A1 107mm Self Propelled (SP) Mortars\n*   220x M101 105mm Howitzers\n*   126x M109A3GN 155mm SP Howitzers\n*   48x M114/39 155mm towed Howitzers (39 calibre barrel)\n*   ~100x M114/23 155mm towed Howitzers (23 calibre barrel) in reserve\n\n**Air Defense Systems**: Several different Air Defense systems were in use. The RBS-70 was very modern and in the Permanent Force units.\n\n*   108x RBS-70 SAMs\n*   132x M1 40mm AA guns\n*   Numerous Bofors 40L60 and 40L70 AA guns\n*   20mm KK-202 towed AA guns\n*   12.7mm Quad towed MGs\n\n**Cessna O-1A Bird Dog Spotter Aircraft**: Very few militaries still used fixed wing spotter aircraft in 1994 but the Norwegian maintained 17 venerable Cessna Bird Dogs for artillery spotting.\n\n![](images/norway army/image013.jpg)',

  '**Norwegian Air Force**: The Norwegian Air Force manages all air activity for the Army, Navy, Coast Guard as well as conducting traditional Air Force tasks. The Primary fighter aircraft is the F-16. Although not part of the Norwegian Air force, a flight of 2 or 3 NATO E-3A AWACS are semi-permanently stationed an on task at Orland.\n\n![](images/norway air force/image001.jpg) **F-16 Falcon**: Norway is one of the four European countries that invested heavily into the F-16 Falconproject, purchasing 60 single seat ‘A‘ models and 12 dual seat ‘B‘ versions. Deployed in four Squadrons each conducts patrols in North Norway on a rotational bases and regularly deploy to dispersal bases throughout the country. A unique feature of Norwegian F-16s is the ability to fire the AGM-119 Penguin 3 missile, an anti-ship armament critical due to the long and exposed coastline and vulnerability from the sea. Historically the first MLU (Mid life Upgrade) aircraft, able to fire the Aim-120 Air to Air missile arrived in 1995, however, that has been advanced by a year in Northern Fury and 338 Squadron has four of the improved aircraft on its roster.\n\nAt the start of Northern Fury, 331 Sqn from Bodo is forward based at Bardufoss with 4 additional ‘B‘ model aircraft, elements of 4 aircraft are dispersed in to Banak, Tromso and Evenes and they are maintaining a 24/7 Combat Air Patrol out of Bardufoss.\n\nAs the photo indicates, encounters with Soviet MiGs in northern Norway were not uncommon.\n\nSqn\n\nName\n\nLocation\n\nNo.\n\nType\n\nRemarks\n\n331\n\nLion\n\nBodo\n\n16\n\nF-16A/B\n\n+4 F-16B\n\n332\n\nEagle\n\nRegge\n\n16\n\nF-16A/B\n\n334\n\nCola\n\nBodo\n\n16\n\nF-16A/B\n\n338\n\nTiger\n\nOrland\n\n12\n\nF-16A/B\n\n\\+ 4 MLU\n\n![](images/norway air force/image002.jpg) **F-5 Tiger II**: Although Norway was in the process of retiring the F-5 Freedom Fighter, increased tensions changed that plan. Historically by 1994 the only F-5s remaining were 718 Sqn at the Fighter training school (14x F5B), 717 Reconnaissance Sqn (16x RF-5A) and 336 Sqn with 24x F-5A focusing on ground attack.

These were civilian pattern Dassaut Falcon executive jets that were heavily modified and sold to several air forces as a stop-gap area EW platform. The programme was quite successful.\n\n![](images/norway air force/image004.jpg) **P-3C & P-3N Orion**: These Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) were operated by No. 333 ‘Hawks‘ Sqn out of Andoya. The four P-3C‘s were standard Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) versions while the two P-3N were modified to operate for the Coast Guard and were unable to carry weapons, did not have a Magnetic Anomaly Detector or Sonobuoys and was only able to conduct area surveillance and other non-military missions.\n\n![](images/norway air force/image005.jpg) **C-130 Hercules**: No. 335 Sqn flying out of Gardermoen air base operated six C-130H Hercules conducting routine transport tasks for all branches of the service including the Coast Guard.\n\n![](images/norway air force/image006.jpg) **Sea King**: Operated for the Coast Guard the Mk43B Sea Kings are primarily for SAR and air ambulance missions but can also be use for maritime patrol and utility tasks. No. 330 ‘Viking‘ Sqn operates these 12 aircraft and they are dispersed in groups of two or three throughout Norway as required by the Coast Guard.\n\n![](images/norway air force/image007.jpg) **Lynx**: Operated by No.337 Sqn primarily from Bardufoss but operating from various bases, these six Mk86 Lynx are meant for SAR and patrol work only. They spend two weeks at a time on board the Nordkapp class OPVs as well as conducting routine rescue and utility work.',
    norway:
  'Norway is one of the 12 original members of the NATO alliance and was initially the only one to share a boarder directly with the Soviet Union. Turkey has shared that distinction since it joined in 1952. With a population hovering around 5 million people and having a long and vulnerable coastline, Norway is dependent on NATO‘s collective defence assurances for its survival. Even though a small country economically, Norway routinely spent over 3% of its GDP on defence, 50% more than NATO required.\n\nNATO realized the critical vulnerability of its northern flank and made provision for rapid deployment to Norway. AMF (ACE \\[Allied Command Europe\\] Mobile Force) deployment and pre-positioned equipment was exercised annually. STANAVFORLANT (Standing Allied Naval Force Atlantic) was also routinely deployed to Norwegian waters. Routine training by British Royal Marines and US Marine Corps units on Norwegian territory familiarized many involved with the intricacies of fighting on Norway‘s rugged terrain. Finally, NATO E-3A AWACs aircraft were continually stationed in Norway at Orland Air base\n\nNorway‘s military is small but highly trained and well equipped to utilize the advantage of terrain to counteract its disadvantage of geography.',
