    "overview",
    "<h3>Northern Fury (Alternate Cold War History)</h3> <p> On the 19th of August 1991, hard-liners in the Soviet leadership, calling themselves the ‘State Emergency Committee‘, launched the ‘August Coup‘ in order to remove Gorbachev from power and prevent the signing of the new union treaty. Although experiencing some initial setbacks and resounding world condemnation - the coup was a success. The concepts of Perestroika and Glasnost, and the economic and political restructuring they implied, were abolished overnight. Independence movements in 14 states were ruthlessly quashed, including those in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Georgia where self-rule had already been declared. Internal strife reminiscent of the 1920‘s lasted for just over a month but the iron rule of the reinvigorated Communist Party prevailed in all areas. </p> <p> NATO watched nervously as their efforts to encourage Eastern European countries away from Dictatorship were methodically dashed. Only Poland and the re-unified Germany managed to avoid the restoration of the Warsaw Pact. Poland has declared itself Neutral and Non-aligned; however significant pro Eastern Bloc movements exist and are in a constant struggle with its emerging Capitalist economy. Germany is in a difficult position as many of its Left Wing political elements have been proposing the abandonment of collective defense as a viable strategy for the future. </p> <p> Meanwhile, NATO was decisively engaged as its (original 16) various governments were attempting to realize the ‘peace dividend‘ by reducing military forces, and employing what is left in non-traditional roles in order to justify costs. With significantly reduced Land, Sea and Air forces embroiled in the Balkans, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Rwanda and The Sudan. Resources are spread thinner than they have been since the 1940‘s. Tensions with Iraq are high and the threat to stability in the Middle East is extreme. </p> <p> On the 9th of February 1994, a Soviet supported Coup toppled the Polish government and sent the emergent democratic state into anarchy. The UN Security council response was futile and an emergency sitting of NATO‘s North Atlantic Council (NAC) was called for the 12th of February. </p> <p> In Norway - The International Olympic Committee (IOC), in consultation with the UN decided to carry on with the Winter Games which were opened in Lillehammer, on February 12th. Soviet and Eastern Bloc countries were represented at the opening ceremonies but many of their athletes were not present at the start of the actual events on the 13th, the Russian Olympic village was empty and initial investigation found that many of the athletes had simply disappeared, while only a few had flown home. Norway has called up its reserves and ordered the IOC to cancel the games and evacuate the Olympic Village. The world is in an uproar over the loss of the Olympic spectacle and TV commentators all over the Globe are criticizing Norway‘s decision. </p>"

    '<h3>Caribbean Fury Background and Scenarios</h3> <p> </p><figure style="max-width:220px;float:right;margin:12px;"> <img src="assets/images/caribbean/image001.jpg"> <figcaption>CV-67 USS John F Kennedy</figcaption> </figure> <b>Caribbean Fury Background:</b> The short Caribbean series represents events running parallel to the early days of Northern Fury. The Soviet Foreign Service has been actively instigating trouble in America‘s back yard. U.S. domestic difficulties and a global ‘Post-Cold War‘ malaise made western response to the evolving issues fragmented, conflicting and generally ineffective. <p></p> <p> In Nicaragua, American withdrawal of all support to the Contra‘s after the Iran-Contra fiasco allowed the Sandinista‘s breathing space; however, when the anti-Sandinista ‘Chamorro‘ government won the election in 1990 the revolutionary movement immediately restarted, ending in a bloody coup in 92 with a Soviet leaning Sandinista Junta in control. A major funding proposal involved the planning and eventual building of a Nicaraguan Canal to compete with Panama, financing, construction and control of which would be from Moscow. </p> <p> <img src="assets/images/caribbean/image002.jpg" style="max-width:320px;float:left;margin:12px;"> Although Honduras maintained a marginally effective government with significant US aid through the 80‘s, the cessation of funding and support of the Contras in Nicaragua left a power vacuum which the US-trained army could not effectively fill. By 1989 the Cinchoneros Liberation movement, now with significant Soviet backing, gained the upper hand when several Army and Air Force units turned to their cause. The televised execution of 37 American soldiers caused world outrage but was quickly eclipsed by events in Europe and elsewhere. US retaliatory cruise missile strikes at rebel targets were followed by a raft of hostage taking incidents, piracy against civilian shipping and a general withdraw of the expatriate community. The success of the widely-anticipated coup in May of 91 was a forgone conclusion, with the former President and family already living at their palatial residence near Portland Oregon. </p> <p> Following the coups in Honduras and Nicaragua, a militaristic anti-American movement gained momentum and these new governments started rearming with cast-off Algerian and Libyan equipment (as these two countries rearm themselves, mostly with Polish and former East German equipment - see Mediterranean Fury) aided by Soviet deception, training, transport and financial resources. </p> <p> An attempted coup in Guatemala failed due to US clandestine activities, but there remains a solid anti-Western sentiment, including significant numbers of displaced jungle fighters who have now taken on the cause of freeing Belize of British rule. Costa Rica has remained stable as has Panama, although attempts in both countries to overthrow western supporting governments have been made, but failed miserably. The El Salvadoran Civil war rages on with both the US backed government and the FNLN precipitating atrocities which get more shocking every year. </p> <p> <img src="assets/images/caribbean/image003.jpg" style="max-width:320px;float:right;margin:12px;"> Colombia has remained staunchly pro-western, and billions of US dollars ensure they remain so. The leftist guerrilla movements that started in the 60‘s, primarily FARC but others also, have gained strength but are relatively well contained. The drug cartels, however, have significant and expanding power, outspending the government on technology and now using safe havens in Honduras and Nicaragua to ease their transport risk. </p> <p> Mexico is showing signs of emerging out of economic and political distress. It is relying heavily on the newly signed North American Free Trade Agreement and the population are expecting great things. So is the world, with the evolving revolt in the Chiapas region causing new concern! From a military standpoint, with only 12 F-5s and Gearing class destroyers, any major conflict domestic or otherwise will undoubtedly draw the US in to stabilize or protect its neighbor. Rebellion is in the wings should NAFTA fail to improve the Mexican economy. </p> <p> Venezuela entered a new phase in its history with Hugo Chavez seizing power during his 2nd Coup attempt in 1992 and the death of President Perez while en route to his impeachment hearings. Sitting on vast oil reserves and solidly linking itself to the new Soviet Government, Venezuela is quickly evolving as a regional power. By exerting political and financial energy and at times the threat of military involvement, neighboring countries are falling into line with Chavez‘s vision of a resurgent Caribbean trading block to control international trade into the Central and South American region. Local U.S., British, Spanish, Dutch, French and other interests have all been negatively affected. </p> <p> <img src="assets/images/caribbean/image004.jpg" style="max-width:320px;float:left;margin:12px;"> US efforts in Haiti and the continuing support of the Dominican Republic continue along historical lines, as does the evolution of the Eastern Caribbean islands. </p> <p> Cuba, as always is the most interesting of the Caribbean countries. With a resurgence of Soviet interest the Cuban military and air force in particular has been experiencing a period of revival not seen since the late 50‘s. It is suspected that most of the older SAM systems have been replaced by newer and much more capable ones, probably SA-10‘s, and that the older MiG 17‘s &amp; 21‘s have been replaced by MiG-23‘s and 29‘s. It is rumoured that a Kilo class submarine is now on the inventory. Two weeks ago, three RORO ships unloaded under cover of darkness, heavy security and some obvious deception measures. All of this was monitored by U.S. security agencies but it is unclear what was unloaded. Indications are that it was not missiles, but probably aircraft, munitions and support equipment of various types. </p> <p> <b>Security Assessments</b>: The chart below should assist in understanding the status of the many Caribbean and Central American countries and their key equipment. </p> <table><thead><tr><td>Country</td><td>Leaning</td><td>Concerns</td><td>Air Force</td><td>Naval Force</td><td>Land Force</td><td>Dependency</td></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Cuba</td><td>Soviet</td><td>Aggressive</td><td>12x MiG-29<br>60x MiG-23<br>48x MiG-21<br>ASW, MPA, EW<br>Multiple SAM Bdes</td><td>3x Koni FF<br>2x Grisha FFL<br>3 Tarantul FFL<br>18-20x OSA II FAC<br>12-15x Ptl Boats<br>2-3x Foxtrot SS<br>?1x Kilo SS?</td><td>140K:<br>3 Armd Div<br>3 Mech Div<br>12 Inf Div<br>1 Arty Div<br>AbBn Bde</td><td>USSR</td></tr> <tr><td>Nicaragua</td><td>Soviet</td><td>Re-arming</td><td>24x MiG-23BN<br>24x MiG-21bis<br>12x Mirage 5D<br>12x Mirage 5DE</td><td>Patrol craft</td><td>80K, COIN</td><td>Libya</td></tr> <tr><td>Honduras</td><td>Soviet</td><td>Re-arming</td><td>12x MiG-23B<br>12x F-5F<br>10x A-37B</td><td>Patrol craft</td><td>50K, COIN</td><td>USSR</td></tr> <tr><td>Venezuela</td><td>N/A</td><td>Independent</td><td>23x F16 Bl 15<br>36x Mirage<br>12x F-5<br>12x AT-27<br>6x Mig-25</td><td>6x Lupo FF<br>6+ patrol craft<br>Several Amphibious ships</td><td>130K:<br>3 Inf Div<br>1 Armd Div<br>1 Jungle Div<br>1 Cavalry Div</td><td>Independent</td></tr> <tr><td>El Salvador</td><td>Divided</td><td>Civil War</td><td>20-30x A-37<br>12x UH-1</td><td>3 patrol craft</td><td>14K, COIN</td><td>Govt - US<br>Rebels - Cuba</td></tr> <tr><td>Mexico</td><td>Western</td><td>Economic</td><td>12x F-5</td><td>2x Ex Gearing DD<br>2x Ex Bronstein FF</td><td>70K, 7x Bdes</td><td>US</td></tr> <tr><td>Haiti</td><td>Western</td><td>Insurrection Mil dissolved in 1995</td><td>Util, Tg</td><td>None</td><td>Internal security</td><td>US/UN</td></tr> <tr><td>Guatemala</td><td>Western</td><td>Insurgency</td><td>None</td><td>Patrol craft</td><td>39K, COIN</td><td>US</td></tr> <tr><td>Belize</td><td>Western</td><td>Insurgency</td><td>Tpt/Trg</td><td>None</td><td>1.5K, 3x Bn</td><td>UK</td></tr> <tr><td>Costa Rica</td><td>Western</td><td>Insurgency</td><td>Utility</td><td>None</td><td>Para Mil guard</td><td>US</td></tr> <tr><td>Panama</td><td>Western</td><td>Insurgency</td><td>Utility/Trg</td><td>None</td><td>Para Mil guard</td><td>US</td></tr> <tr><td>Columbia</td><td>Western</td><td>Drugs/insurg</td><td>16x A-37<br>12x Kfir C2<br>Recon, EW, MPA, Tanker, Tpt, Trg, Util</td><td>4x Padilla FFL<br>1x Dealey DE<br>2x Type 209 SS<br>2x CG Cutters<br>Patrol craft</td><td>250K, 8x Div</td><td>US</td></tr> <tr><td>Aruba, Bonair, Curacao (ABC)</td><td>Western</td><td>Proximity to Venezuela</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>None</td><td>Netherlands</td></tr> <tr><td>Trinidad &amp;

    '<h3>Northern Fury Background and Scenarios</h3> <p>The Northern Fury scenarios follow a campaign from the initial Soviet onslaught through Norway and the North Atlantic all the way to the conclusion of the war. This campaign is the genesis of the alternate history created by Northern Fury and is the central theme running through the story.</p> <p>The scenarios, fifty eight (58) in total, depict the epic struggle of a resurgent Soviet fleet attempting to strangle NATO and force a favorable situation for resolution at the bargaining table. The USSR feels, and is in fact being, strangled by the west. Their real objective is a Europe without NATO, and with the US no longer having control over potential trading partners in a region tired of a century of warfare, hot and cold.</p> <p>The scope and scale of the confrontation provide little or no room for the political wrangling and double-speak we in the real world have become so accustomed to in the past 25 years. A ‘coalition of the willing‘ is generally not needed in a global war of survival. NATO‘s search for a new reason to exit is obviously no longer in question and nations respond to General Defense Plans (GDP) long practiced and still remembered by governments and militaries steeped in Cold War experience.</p> <p>NATO however, is caught ‘flat-footed‘ by the surprise Soviet attack, its forces are out of place, and some are out of date. Some nations realized as early as 1990 that the ‘Peace Dividend‘ was a phantom dream of the optimistic elements of society, others did not. The gradual increase in tension, proliferation of older weapons systems, political turmoil in the third world and outright hostility of the hard line Soviet regimes policies did eventually convince all that the Cold war was getting colder. By the winter of 1993/94 even the most reluctant were once again looking over their war stocks, some in horror at how quickly equipment and training succumb to the atrophy of neglect. </p> <p>This is genuinely a conflict at the cusp of technological revolution. Digital warfare is in its infancy, many nations are using Viet Nam era equipment while some cutting edge technologies are making their first appearance. The play of these scenarios shows advantages and the disadvantages of these high tech systems, precise and deadly but rare and tricky to use. Juxtaposed with the mass of 60‘s era dumb bombs and dead reckoning, combining the new and the old provides the player with some very interesting results. The technology gap is not all one-sided, the USSR has invested heavily in new technology, so whether it is F-4 Phantoms going up against Su-27‘s or F-15‘s meeting MiG-21‘s the clash of layered technology gaps makes the battle challenging.</p> <p>When tackling a campaign of this magnitude it quickly becomes apparent that two things rule the flow of conflict far more than any other factor: Logistics and time. Every attempt has been made to limit both sides to the physical reality of these two factors, munitions are limited, fuel for both ships and aircraft must be provided, numbers and availability of resources are tacked. Benefit of the doubt has been granted to logistics staff of both sides who would be making super-human efforts to keep things working, but limits of speed and capacity rule some key decisions made by in the design and hoisted onto the player. I hope that this adds a context of reality and an enriched experience for the gamer who follows this story from scenario to scenario.</p> <p>Some of these scenarios are playable by both sides but most are NATO only, as that truly shows the desperation of the situation from the viewpoint of the defender. Although the campaign is designed to be played sequentially, this could be daunting as some of the earlier scenarios are also some of the most challenging. I recommend that you are reasonably familiar with the mechanics of COMMAND before attempting the first two scenarios, but many of the others are quite manageable to the novice player. Linkages with several other campaigns become evident through this series; Mediterranean Fury is raging but strategic decisions by NATO provide more resources for Northern Fury. Caribbean Fury is an initial distraction for the US, UK, the Netherlands and France but once the situation there appears to calm down, more assets are forthcoming. The events in Baltic Fury become a major threat to the success of this campaign, causing some critical timing decisions that the player is forced to live with. Even the far off campaigns in Indian Ocean and Pacific Fury, have an impact on the player.

    '<p> The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (<a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/index.htm" target="_blank">NATO</a>) was formed on 4 April 1949, as a Military/Political body to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact (WP)countries. The basis of the alliance is the collective defence codified in <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/topics_110496.htm" target="_blank">Article Five</a> of the treaty which states: <i>"...that an attack against one Ally is considered as an attack against all Allies." </i> </p><p> The 12 founding members of NATO are: </p><ul> <li>Belgium,</li> <li>Canada, </li> <li>Denmark,</li> <li>France, (Withdrew from NATO‘s integrated military command in 1966, rejoined 1994.)</li> <li>Iceland, </li> <li>Italy, </li> <li>Luxembourg, </li> <li>the Netherlands, </li> <li>Norway, </li> <li>Portugal, </li> <li>the United Kingdom, and </li> <li>the United States.</li> </ul><p></p> <p> The following countries joined NATO between its foundation and the start of Northern Fury in 1994: </p><ul> <li>Greece (1952)</li> <li>Turkey (1952)</li> <li>West Germany (1955)</li> <li>Spain (1982)</li> </ul> <p></p><p> The reunification of Germany in 1990, meant that the former East Germany was drawn into NATO. Between 1989 and 1994 the reunification of Germany became a major friction point between NATO and western European countries and a resurgent Soviet Union. </p><p> Collectively this force - in Europe alone - amounted to over 3.7 million soldiers, sailors and airmen under arms, tens of thousands of armoured vehicles, thousands of aircraft and hundreds of ships. A formidable force. Command of this force, with 16 governments and defence ministries involved however can be complex, not to mention the scale of the geography and diversity of capabilities. At the top of the Command Structure is a political body - the North Atlantic Council (NAC) which oversaw the military element of the Alliance on behalf of the member nations. Next in line was the NATO Military Committee (NMC), which issued broad policy, interfaced with the NAC and had direct communications with each nations Ministry of Defence (or equivalent). While the NAC and NMC dealt with issues at the Strategic level, operational planning and execution of warfighting tasks was conducted by three commanders: Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) commanding all forces in Europe (Allied Command Europe); Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) commanding all forces in the Atlantic (Allied Command Atlantic); and Commander-in-Chief Allied Command Channel (CINCCHAN). The remainder of the operational portion of the NATO command structure is depicted on the chart below: </p> <img src="images/nato/image001.png"> <p> On the tactical level were dozens of Corps, Air Forces and Fleets, however clear distinction below the level depicted becomes complex because many of the commanders were ‘double hatted‘ meaning the Commander had two roles. For instance, SACLANT was also Commander US 2nd Fleet, and Commander NATO Strike Fleet Atlantic (STRIKFLEETLANT). Another example is that CINCCHAN, was not a ‘Supreme‘ Commander as the other two (SACEUR &amp; SACLANT) but he was Commander in Chief FLEET (British Royal Navy) and Commander in Chief Eastern Atlantic Area, under SACLANT. </p><p> Instead of digging into the detail of NATO‘s tactical structures, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_NATO#Structure_in_1989" target="_blank">this Wiki page</a> provides a good summary in the section ‘Structure in 1989‘. </p>'
